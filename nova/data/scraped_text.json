            "extracted_text": "Telemedicine is a tool for transferring comprehensive primary health care (CPHC) services to rural areas of India. The question raises an extensive pathway for strengthening telemedicine systems in terms of integration in rural and remote areas to reach comprehensive primary health care (CPHC) services through Health and Wellness Centers (HWCs), where tribal populations are primarily living. But, after spending lots of efforts in the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) program for the public health benefit, especially reachable to rural and remote areas, the government announced the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) scheme and HWCs in the Ayushman Bharat (AB) scheme on September 23, 2018 and continues functioning with the aim of providing public funding up to 5 lakh Rs. per family per year, covering health expenditures of 500 million people.1 These schemes are for people who are below the poverty line (BPL) and could benefit from point care at HWCs. Then some issues are known in rural and difficult geographical regions, like poor road conditions, no large hospitals or health clinics, and basic infrastructure and services, such as ambulance services, in the remotest areas. On the other side, maintaining the health system\u2019s ability to provide health services for all such people under Universal Health Coverage. It is vital to have skilled and available health workers.2 The plight of India's rural people and vulnerable communities accounted for about 68.84% of the entire population; many of them have inadequate access to decent health care services. India has the world's second-largest tribal population, accounting for 8.6% of the Schedule Tribe (ST) populations (104 million). These are mostly rural and remote areas with 41% literacy and also 41% below the poverty line with poor maternal and child health.3 The people are lacking the basic standard of livelihood that\u2019s urgently needed for primary medical care too. So, by bringing together urban and rural healthcare facilities, telemedicine should help accelerate and achieve the goal of UHC, which is indispensable to improving quality health care services in rural areas.\n\nIndia\u2019s ambitious plan to reach health facilities to all citizens everywhere by 2030, well ahead of the Ayushman Bharat Scheme under the government icon program \u2018Universal Health Coverage\u2019, is tacking progressive. Telemedicine offers an added advantage over traditional methods, as it allows needy people to receive medical care at their doorsteps4\n\nIt is an important component of the UHC. The worldwide availability and acceptability of phones have been a real blessing in bringing technology to the masses. Patients will be able to communicate quickly in any emergency through regular conferences with their doctor. It enables patients to receive the required and immediate medical care without having to exert much effort.5 For instance, recently, it played a major role in helping patients to connect with doctors\u2019 while being at home, thereby avoiding the risk of getting infected with the Corona virus and visiting hospitals.6 Moreover, it is successfully employed for continuum care and quality management of health by monitoring critical signs of non-communicable diseases (NCD), including blood pressure (BP), blood sugar levels, communicable diseases including tuberculosis (TB), malaria, fever, etc., and other needed activities that can be accomplished from home. Furthermore, Sareh Keshvardoost et al. (2021) emphasized the importance of telemedicine and its role in reducing pollution by allowing patients and doctors to interact via e-portals without having to travel.7\n\nThe telemedicine system is a boon, but numerous studies have highlighted the lack of technological and telecommunication infrastructure in developing countries like China and India.8 The acceptance of telemedicine technologies by both patients and healthcare providers among Native Americans has been seen as an implementation barrier to the telemedicine system.9 Also, other pitfalls include a tendency to make clinical errors (sometimes) due to a lack of patient examination and case history and patients\u2019 dissatisfaction with a lack of face-to-face interaction with doctors.\n\nThe authors opined that telemedicine does not replace the need for well-equipped hospitals in the village, but it bridges the gaps between patients and healthcare professionals, reducing the risk of health loss. It also minimizes the costs of healthcare, which obstruct access to high-quality care delivery and also deter approaching patients from accessing healthcare at all.10 Traditional care models, on the other hand, require patients and health care providers to drive vehicles to visit each other. The adequate advantage of telemedicine in supporting fewer carbon emissions is a potential climate change mitigation strategy not only in rural areas but also in urban settings.11 The concept's results demonstrate that telemedicine aligns with and is practical in achieving UHC objectives, as demonstrated by its visual representation.\n\nFinally, it should facilitate the acceleration of India's UHC initiative by promoting the adoption of telemedicine at the village level. This could be achieved by providing phones, tablets, and internet connectivity at community meeting places or Panchayat Bhawans, which are under the control of the village or community heads, while also implementing minor reforms to the telemedicine system. Along with generating healthcare awareness among health workers in HWCs, consider extended-point primary care units in villages. We are particularly critical of a non-health facility village that is not located within a 5-kilometer radius of the Community Health Centre (CHC), Primary Health Centre (PHC), Sub-Health Centre (SHC), and Health and Wellness Centers (HWC). In this context, we must initiate effective training programs for villagers, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), Anganwadi Workers (AWW), and school teachers, with the aim of facilitating easy communication between needy individuals and their physicians via telephone and in-person conversations. These opinions and views need to be incorporated into effective policies; it could change the face of healthcare receivers, and poor communities should be mobilized towards HWCs to avail themselves of the health benefits. Only a strong association between the people and healthcare providers can be able to make reachable health facilities among rural and remote areas patients by connecting their nearer health and wellness centers from their village, which should be a great extension in accelerating the UHC program as health for all citizens without any hardship."

            "extracted_text": "The third session of the workshop focused on the national landscape of rural health care services, the role of tribal health care entities across rural America, the function of wraparound services in rural communities, and the contribution of community health workers (CHWs) to rural health care. The session was moderated by Tom Morris from the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges and opportunities in rural areas, said Moore. The increasing COVID-19 case numbers in rural states appear to dispel the idea that rural communities with more space might fare better than urban areas. He noted that rural regions such as western Kansas and Oklahoma did not initially see the COVID19 transmission rates that urban centers such as New York City and Chicago experienced, but those rural areas were experiencing a dramatic increase in cases as of late June 2020. 7 He remarked that the pandemic has shone a glaring light on enduring and far-reaching issues, including the racial, ethnic, and economic health disparities in rural areas, and it has underscored the need to improve access and surge capacity in rural areas. He suggested that there are opportunities associated with COVID-19 as well, given that \u201ca few months of pandemic accomplished in telehealth what years of advocacy could not.\u201d Moore also proposed that alternative payment models and system designs may better align with the need to maintain access to quality health care services in the rural health care landscape than the current structures.\n\nMoore also described some of the innovations that are taking place in the rural health landscape to counteract some of the negative trends. Successful examples that can provide helpful insights include the Frontier Extended Stay Clinic, the recently closed Frontier Community Health Integration project, the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration program, and rural state innovation models. 5 CMS has ongoing rural value-based initiatives such as accountable care organizations (ACOs), which are making good inroads in rural areas. The next generation of the ACO model includes state-located models, such as Vermont\u2019s all-payer ACO system as well as the Pennsylvania rural health model. 6 He noted that the latter model uses global budgeting, and thus far, hospitals with global budgets appear more resistant to pandemic-induced fluctuations caused by the cancellation of elective surgeries and outpatient appointments.\n\nHe explained that dollars pertains to the economics of rural areas, as rural populations are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and typically have fewer affordable health insurance options than their urban counterparts. Departure refers to the closure of rural health care facilities: since January 2010, 130 rural hospitals have closed ( Thomas et al., 2019 ). Of these, 43 were CAHs receiving cost-based Medicare reimbursement, which indicates that these CAHs were so financially vulnerable that this reimbursement was not sufficient to keep them open. The remaining 87 hospitals were noncritical access or prospective payment system hospitals with other Medicare designations. He added that many more rural hospitals are continuing to operate with a high degree of financial vulnerability.\n\nThe negative effects on rural health care are evident across what Moore describes as the \u201cfive Ds\u201d: death rates, disparities, distance, dollars, and departures. Death rates show that the life expectancy in rural areas is 3 years shorter than for people in urban areas. Furthermore, rural communities have higher death rates for heart disease and stroke. Rural women face higher maternal mortality rates than their urban counterparts. Disparities are present in a number of health factors, in part because rural residents face higher rates of tobacco use, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. The disparity in the distribution of and access to health care providers extends beyond physical health care, he added. Rural populations face greater challenges with mental and behavioral health than people living in urban areas, yet they generally have limited access to mental health care. Distance is also a factor, given that rural areas have limited or nonexistent public transportation infrastructure. Rural residents often face long distances between their homes and health care providers and do not always have access to a vehicle, making it difficult to access emergency care, specialty care, and preventive care.\n\nMoore outlined various disparities in the rural health care landscape. He remarked that despite the broad range of health care facilities and providers who serve rural areas, maldistribution within the health care workforce infrastructure is a major issue. While approximately 18 percent of the nation\u2019s population is rural, only 10 percent of primary care practitioners and less than 7 percent of specialty care practitioners reside in rural areas. Furthermore, approximately 5 percent of rural counties do not have any family physicians.\n\nThese three types of designated providers are examples of how various federal policy levers, such as reimbursement, are used to support rural hospitals, clinics, and providers, said Moore. However, many other types of providers play important roles in the rural health care landscape. These include long-term care facilities that serve Medicare and dual-eligible Medicaid patient populations, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and residential services for people with disabilities. 4 Other types of rural service providers include tribal clinics and hospitals, Veterans Affairs clinics and hospitals, home health care, hospice, occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy, pharmacies, dentists, mental and behavioral health providers, and community health aides.\n\nFQHCs are administered by HRSA\u2019s Bureau of Primary Healthcare after being established in the 1960s as part of the war on poverty. 3 Designed as a demonstration program to provide access to health and social services to medically underserved and disenfranchised populations, FQHCs are located in both urban and rural areas. Currently, about 40 percent of the 14,000 FQHC sites are in rural communities. FQHCs provide a menu of services and are required to see all patients regardless of ability to pay, he noted.\n\nMoore provided more detail on these three types of provider designations. CAHs were created as a special designation under Medicare by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. These facilities have a limit of 25 beds or less and a limitation on length of stay, which currently averages 96 hours. 1 Of the approximately 2,000 rural hospitals nationwide, more than 1,450 are CAHs. He added that in most rural communities, small rural hospitals and CAHs often serve as the linchpin of the health care system. Although a substantial number of local, county, or city-owned and managed hospitals are still in operation, system consolidation is on the rise. This is leading to a mix of systems in some settings, such as urban health systems that include some rural providers, mixed rural and urban systems, and private management affiliations and groups of hospitals. The designation \u201crural health clinic\u201d was created in 1977 as part of the Rural Health Clinic Services Act. 2 Rural health clinics receive certification from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) based in part on their location. These clinics, which receive special all-inclusive rate payments, can be either independent or provider based and must be staffed by both physicians and either nurse practitioners or physician assistants.\n\nPaul Moore from the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy at HRSA presented data on rural health provider infrastructure, explored challenges and disparities in rural health care, and discussed the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on health care access in rural communities. He remarked that although fewer doctors in rural areas are making house calls and delivering babies in local emergency departments (EDs) than in the past, independent physicians in rural towns continue to feature prominently in the rural health care landscape (e.g., by staffing EDs as needed and making hospital rounds on their patients before they begin their in-office practice each day).\n\nCalac noted the IHS health care workforce shortage across all types of health care providers. In 2015, IHS had vacancy rates of 16 percent for pharmacists, 24 percent for nurses, 26 percent for dentists, 32 percent for physician assistants, 34 percent for physicians, and 35 percent for advanced practice registered nurses. Furthermore, the matriculation rates of American Indian medical students are low. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges\u2019 2017 data for medical school graduates, of the 93,000 individuals who graduated between 2012 and 2017, only 131 identified as American Indian or Alaska Native\u2014a number of graduates that is insufficient to meet the needs of 570 different tribal entities. Calac emphasized that this and the underfunding of IHS pose major problems for the delivery of health care and the improvement of health care in these populations.\n\nCalac highlighted some of the many factors that affect the quality of life of American Indians and Alaska Natives, including barriers to accessing health care that are geographic, educational, institutional, social, or financial. Distance to health care providers can be a geographic barrier to care, as can mountainous regions that are difficult and even dangerous to traverse. Educational barriers are evidenced by lower graduation rates. In 2014\u20132015, the American Indian population had a high school graduation rate of 71.6 percent, compared to 83.2 percent for the general population. This disparity is even greater at the postsecondary level, with 19.8 percent of American Indians receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree versus 32.5 percent of all adults in the United States. 11 Institutional challenges include the funding cycle for IHS, which is year to year instead of the protracted 5-year or 10-year budget cycle that corporations and many communities can rely on for funding individual programs. Furthermore, IHS programs are consistently underfunded by as much as 40 percent, with prominent shortages in funding for mental health. Calac said a social barrier is the ongoing and persistent trend of low use of preventive health care due to the perception of health care as the use of urgent or emergency care. Lastly, the financial barriers faced by the American Indian population are substantial. In 2014, approximately 28 percent of the Indigenous population was living in poverty compared with 15.5 percent for all Americans. 12 Per capita health care spending on American Indians is also lower than for other populations. In 2005, IHS spent an average of $3,099 per recipient, less than half of the $8,097 per capita rate for Medicaid recipients. 13 Calac added that this disparity has not changed much since 2005, with IHS receiving lower per capita medical expense rates than even the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nHe noted that health literacy is a fundamental component of health equity that is particularly relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as understanding the difference between an antibody test and a polymerase chain reaction test, knowing what RNA means in terms of viral particles, and knowing the appropriate doses of over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen. Transportation is an aspect of health equity that is particularly relevant for rural communities, he noted. Multiple challenges come into play when people in rural areas have long distances between their homes and health care, such as adequate infrastructure in terms of roads and access to vehicles. Finally, crime and safety influences on health equity can be seen in the opioid epidemic, which is heavily affecting rural areas. Calac added that challenges related to Mexican cartels trafficking heroin through rural areas, as well as human trafficking in these regions, are also continuing problems. These types of disparities in health equity result in disparities in measures such as life expectancy, he emphasized. The life span of American Indians, at a median 76 years, is 5 years shorter than the median 81 years of the general population. Calac stated that in more impoverished areas, such as in the Dakotas, and in areas distant from hospitals and major clinics, the average life span can be as much as 20 years shorter for some native populations.\n\nMany Indian health care clinics rely on grant funding to provide basic health care to tribal communities. Calac\u2019s organization, the Indian Health Council, uses a facility model that has been replicated throughout California, a state that is home to 42 Indian health care clinics and 7 urban Indian health clinics. This type of facility offers a multidisciplinary range of services, such as medical, dental, and medical subspecialties, including optometry, acupuncture, and behavioral health; these facilities also address public health issues affecting tribal entities. He added that this approach to a clinic as a \u201chealth village\u201d rather than a \u201chealth facility\u201d helps to engage people and imbue them with a sense of ownership of the clinics, thus encouraging people to access services.\n\nCalac explained that IHS currently has 12 service areas across the United States. Regardless of geography or the specific tribal entities, the burden of disease and health care disparities are common throughout these service areas. 9 IHS operates 31 hospitals and 50 health centers, some of which are FQHCs. Two school-based IHS health centers enable service delivery to at-risk children, including the preventive health care needed at younger ages. IHS also oversees 31 health stations that were developed collaboratively by individual tribes and the IHS over the past 50 to 60 years. Calac said these stations offer more appropriate care than settings serving larger populations, because they provide an individualized level of care tailored to the communities they serve. Given the differences among the 570 distinct tribes, this type of community-specific approach is critical for meeting the specific needs of tribal entities.\n\nWhen American Indians traded land with fertile soil or river access to the United States, the treaty obligations and the needs of this population did not evaporate with their relocation, said Calac. The U.S. government has shifted responsibility for meeting these obligations to various agencies over time. Initially, a division within the Department of War oversaw health services for American Indians. In 1849, this responsibility was transferred to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Congress ratified appropriations with the 1921 Snyder Act, landmark legislation that defined the governmental responsibility for American Indian health care. Service delivery for American Indians was transferred to the Public Health Service in 1954 before shifting again to the newly formed Indian Health Service (IHS) the following year ( Warne and Frizzell, 2014 ). The Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976 was another landmark piece of legislation, which offered assurances for the delivery of high-quality health care for the underserved Indigenous population.\n\nCalac provided some historical perspective about the lingering impact of colonialism and past treaties with the U.S. government on the way many tribal entities perceive health care. As part of negotiations between American Indian nations and the U.S. government, a prepaid health care plan was pledged for native people. However, a common sentiment is that this health plan was prepaid by the cession of the entirety of the American Indian peoples\u2019 lands (Rhoades and Derre Smith, 1996 ). This perception is compounded by a rural health care system that is struggling to maintain an adequate level of increasingly complex care for American Indian populations.\n\nDaniel Calac from the Indian Health Council discussed the diversity among American Indian populations, the magnitude of American Indian/ Alaska Native health disparities, the factors affecting the quality of life, and the severity of the biomedical workforce shortage affecting this sector of the U.S. population. The American Indian presence in the United States is highly diverse. Nearly 600 tribes currently live across the country, with more than 570 of these officially recognized by the U.S. federal government. 8 Language varies between tribes, as indicated by the existence of more than 350 distinct dialects. Furthermore, native individuals may have distinct customs and diverse cultural norms that contribute to the level of care they deem appropriate. Substantial variety may exist even among nearby tribes, he added. For example, Calac\u2019s organization near San Diego County serves nine individual reservations and tribes that are located within a 5-mile radius, all of which have their own unique customs.\n\nMenachemi remarked that the issues that have historically impeded access to primary care and dental services are being overcome, which may provide an opportunity for wraparound services to play a role in enhancing care in rural areas. He added that telehealth\u2014which is rapidly expanding due to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014could potentially be used as a platform for delivering wraparound services. The use of wraparound services via telemedicine has not yet been studied, but he suggested that it could be useful if geographic access is a limiting factor. However, telehealth may not be as helpful in relieving the financial barriers to service provision in many rural communities, so the proliferation of telehealth could widen disparities in rural areas if financial and other barriers prevent access (June-Ho Kim and Cole, 2020 ).\n\nMenachemi suggested that in many ways, rural settings may be ideal for wraparound services because rural populations tend to have many needs stemming from unfavorable social determinants. Therefore, he suggested exploring ways to integrate the expertise of various providers working to mitigate the unfavorable ramifications of SDOH. He described several studies that illustrate the potential benefit of implementing wraparound services in rural areas. One study looked at a dental clinic that used the wraparound service of transportation assistance, finding that dental treatment completion rates increased with transportation assistance in place ( Larson et al., 2019 ). The study also found that most wraparound services are supported via grants or philanthropy, making them vulnerable to funding disruptions. Menachemi said that this type of vulnerability is more likely when the financial model of delivering care is not aligned with the engagement of wraparound services. Another study looked at substance use disorder treatment centers in both rural and urban areas (Bond Edmond et al., 2015 ). Centers in rural locations were far less likely to offer wraparound services than their urban counterparts because of challenges in rural areas, including the stigma on behavioral health care issues ( Pullmann et al., 2010 ). He said that many of the barriers to wraparound services in rural areas are the same barriers seen in accessing medical and primary care: transportation issues, limited funding, service availability, a shortage of wraparound service providers, and long distances between facilities all pose challenges to accessing wraparound services in rural locations.\n\nBoth rural and urban areas are seeing a low uptake of wraparound services, noted Menachemi. He attributed this to the historic fee-for-service incentive structure\u2014a somewhat perverse incentive structure that was implemented because most providers and facilities are set up to address acute issues rather than the chronic conditions that are largely driven by the SDOH. This effectively disincentivized wraparound services, despite the fact that wraparound services can reduce the need for future services that are costlier. The study conducted by Menachemi and colleagues on wraparound services in an Indianapolis FQHC indicated an average annual cost savings of approximately $2 million ( Vest et al., 2018 ). He noted that under a fee-for-service structure, cost savings are actually a reduction in revenue, whereas under full capitation, 14 they represent true savings for the provider. Therefore, the financial incentives and reimbursement model used will affect whether or not the use of wraparound services is incentivized. He said that wraparound services are most frequently geared toward vulnerable groups, as this model is more readily adopted by FQHCs and clinics that disproportionately cater to vulnerable individuals. The focus of these settings, reflected in their goals and mission, is usually on ameliorating challenges and not necessarily on generating revenue.\n\nAnother example of wraparound services is the inclusion of mental health, child care, family services, and vocational training in substance use disorder treatment clinics. Menachemi and colleagues published a study of FQHCs in inner-city Indianapolis, Indiana, where wraparound services included social work, dietician assistance, and patient navigation ( Vest et al., 2018 ). These wraparound services reduced hospitalizations and emergency department visits in the years following the rollout of these services. Another study that focused on nutritionists found that seeing a dietician can improve a patient\u2019s diet quality, diabetes outcomes, and weight loss ( Mitchell et al., 2017 ). The co-location of behavioral health wraparound services in primary care settings was the focus of another study, which found that this co-location can reduce wait times for treatments and increase both patient engagement in care and patient use of needed services ( Possemato et al., 2018 ).\n\nA number of studies have measured the effect of wraparound services on patient outcomes, said Menachemi. In one study, referrals by health care professionals to social service providers led to a decrease in patient-reported needs, indicating that social services were able to address and eliminate some patient needs ( Gottlieb et al., 2016 ). Wraparound services also increased parent and caregiver perception that their children\u2019s health needs were being met. Another study examined medical\u2013legal wraparound partnerships in which attorneys provide pro bono consultative services to people in health care settings; it found these partnerships address legal issues that exacerbate poor health ( Sandel et al., 2010 ). An example of how medical\u2013legal partnerships can address such issues is the addition of legal forms to electronic health records, which can aid in processes such as rectifying substandard housing conditions for low-income patients. Other cases might involve a parent who is unable to afford a child\u2019s medications because of failure of the other parent to make child support payments. Medical\u2013legal partnerships address these types of situations in working toward the ultimate goal of increasing a patient\u2019s ability to manage disease, he explained.\n\nMost wraparound services are designed to address one or more of the social determinants of health (SDOH), said Menachemi. depicts wraparound services related to each SDOH and the health outcomes associated with those SDOH. For example, social workers can assist with vocational training or housing issues, and dieticians focus on matters related to food and nutrition. Mental health counselors can help people provide information to manage stress and, to some degree, cope with discrimination, address social integration, and support systems. Wraparound services can include anything that enhances an individual\u2019s ability to maintain health or cope with disease, he added, because wraparound service providers are essentially working to mitigate the potentially negative effects of certain SDOH.\n\nMenachemi explained that the term wraparound applies to nonmedical services provided in conjunction with primary care. Traditional wraparound services include social work, behavioral health, nutrition and diet, pharmacy assistance, and patient navigation. More recently, wraparound services have included financial counseling, which assists individuals in managing nonmedical aspects of their lives to enable them to better manage medical issues. Similarly, medical\u2013legal partnerships have formed because legal services addressing challenges in people\u2019s lives may increase their ability to focus on and maintain health. Traditionally, access to these types of services has been via referrals to outside agencies. However, some FQHCs are now collocating these services with primary care and scheduling wraparound service providers to meet with patients at their primary care appointments, thereby increasing use of these services.\n\nNir Menachemi from Indiana University provided an overview of wraparound services, wraparound program outcomes, challenges to the adoption of this service delivery model, and implications for rural health. He noted that although the majority of studies he presented were conducted in urban areas\u2014mostly in FQHCs in inner-city urban areas\u2014these types of wraparound services would also benefit rural areas.\n\nCertain challenges that have emerged during the pandemic particularly affect rural CHWs, said Callaghan. Because of a lack of Internet access in many rural areas, some rural CHWs cannot use teleconferencing with their clients, making it more difficult to provide socially distanced services. In addition, many CHWs have been laid off because of the reduced funding many organizations have experienced during the pandemic. Additionally, billing for in-person services addressing SDOH is even more difficult when these services are provided online.\n\nCallaghan stated that research by his team suggests that CHWs are taking on new roles in response to the pandemic. A prominent role is contract tracing, which is vital to understanding the spread of the disease. Callaghan said that CHWs are well qualified for this role because they come from the communities they serve, enabling them to provide culturally appropriate support and establish trust with patients in a way that might be more difficult for contract tracers from outside the community. CHWs\u2019 pandemic-expanded roles also include tasks such as making masks for vulnerable individuals and picking up groceries for individuals who might be too vulnerable to go into stores themselves. As CHWs continue to perform their previous roles, they have had to adapt their work in order to practice social distancing\u2014including increased use of teleconferencing technologies to safely connect to clients.\n\nCallaghan noted that extensive efforts to train CHWs across the country to address the global pandemic began almost as soon as COVID-19 started spreading across the United States. In Texas, for example, the first training sessions were held in early March, including a session in South Texas for promotores along the Texas\u2013Mexico border. The National Association of Community Health Workers, 17 the American Public Health Association\u2019s CHW Section, 18 and various training centers across the country have been promoting CHW workshops to help them fight the coronavirus pandemic and to ensure that CHWs are staying safe.\n\nThe second major challenge repeatedly cited by CHWs was payment, with respect to both sources of funding and practices for billing. Many CHWs reported working in grant-funded positions that do not provide them with long-term security, because their jobs may disappear with the end of the grant cycle. Challenges in billing practices relate to the lack of billing codes for services to address SDOH and other social factors of health outcomes, said Callaghan. The challenges involved in funding CHW positions can discourage health care providers from hiring CHWs despite the improvements they can have on patient outcomes.\n\nCallaghan explained that beyond the lack of resources available for rural clients, there are challenges within the way CHW jobs are structured. Even as this field grows, CHW study participants repeatedly noted key barriers to expanding the workforce in ways that would particularly benefit rural America. Two of the barriers emerged as most prominent in the study. The first issue is the variety of terminology used to describe CHW positions. Callaghan and his team identified dozens of terms for CHWs such as promotor(a) , health educator, and health navigator. The absence of a widely accepted nomenclature poses challenges to the professionalization of this field, as terminology is important in the creation of regulations and consistent standards. Without an agreed-upon term for CHWs, confusion might arise as to whether state and federal laws and regulations are applicable. For example, if a law is passed in Texas focused on CHWs, people working under the title of promotor(a) or health educator may be unclear as to whether the law applies to them.\n\nIn rural areas here, there\u2019s less transportation, there\u2019s less resources, there\u2019s less funding. Sometimes it can be trying. We have a program right now that CHWs work with: if you\u2019re struggling with food, we can give you a gift card for a certain amount, each person in the house, but that\u2019s limited. We can\u2019t give it to everybody, and everybody at some point has problems with food insecurities.\n\nCallaghan noted that in addition to the reduced number of programs in rural areas, CHWs in these regions also have fewer resources available to which their clients can be linked. Even where there are programs available in rural areas, they tend to be more limited than in cities. In contrast, patients in some urban areas can be overwhelmed with the number of resources that are potentially available to them, as was articulated by an urban CHW:\n\nIn an urban setting often they\u2019re adding a CHW specialized in diabetes, specialized in prenatal care, specialized in something that they can really train that individual, and they have a large enough population that they can serve just that population, and that it really makes that difference in those urban areas. And I think the big thing I\u2019ve seen different for us in a rural area is we have to be very generalist.\n\nBeyond demographics, the work performed by CHWs looks different in urban versus rural areas. Callaghan highlighted two key differences that were evident in the focus groups. The first is that urban CHWs tend to be specialists that are highly focused on a specific task (e.g., enrolling individuals in a program), a certain subpopulation, or a specific disease like diabetes. In contrast, rural CHWs tend to be generalists. They are more likely to address all of the needs of the individuals because there may be no equivalent health care workers in the area to address patients\u2019 various needs. As a CHW in rural Minnesota remarked:\n\nThe demographic characteristics of rural and urban CHWs also differ, said Callaghan. The average age of rural CHWs is about 3 years older than their urban counterparts, which is consistent with the demographics of the general population living in rural areas. Rural CHWs also tend to have lower levels of education, with 42.3 percent holding a bachelor\u2019s degree compared to 52.3 percent of urban CHWs. An overwhelming majority (90 percent) of CHWs in the survey data were female. This trend is even more pronounced in rural areas, where only 6.2 percent of CHWs are male, than in urban areas, where 12.5 percent are male.\n\nCallaghan reported that in both rural and urban areas, CHWs are employed in a variety of settings: hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices, clinics, nonprofits, academic institutions, and community outreach organizations. However, certain trends emerge when looking at the percentages of urban and rural CHWs working in each of these settings. For example, urban CHWs are more likely to work in hospitals and in community outreach settings than their rural counterparts. He attributed this to a lack of hospitals in rural areas and the long distances rural CHWs would have to travel to go door to door for community outreach. Instead, rural CHWs are more likely to be working in doctors\u2019 offices and clinics. Additionally, they are more likely than urban CHWs to work in roles that are harder to define or categorized as \u201cother\u201d because their work does not fit neatly into the specified category descriptions.\n\nThe increasing numbers of CHWs are filling a vital role in the health care system, said Callaghan. The value of CHWs extends to rural areas, where they can help patients address the considerable barriers rural Americans face in accessing health care services. These barriers include transportation issues, limited numbers of providers, barriers to hospital access, and limited social programs. Callaghan suggested that if CHWs are uniquely positioned to help link clients to resources, they might be even more important in rural areas where those resources are scarce. The CHW survey data indicate that 28.9 percent of CHWs primarily serve rural clients, while 43.4 percent primarily work with urban clients.\n\nTo describe the roles of CHWs in rural and urban settings in the United States, Callaghan used two sources of original data from research conducted with support from the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy. 16 The first source is a series of focus groups held with CHWs in rural and urban parts of California, Florida, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in 2018 and 2019. The second came from a large 2019 survey of more than 1,400 CHW participants from 45 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Callaghan explained that when CHWs were asked to describe their own roles during the focus groups and surveys, three themes emerged: (1) linking clients to resources, (2) focusing on SDOH, and (3) providing insights to other health care providers about clients that might otherwise be missed (see Box 4-1 ). CHWs in both urban and rural areas highlighted their roles in linking clients to resources, suggesting that in being a part of the communities they serve, CHWs are enabled to better understand the needs of clients because they may have experienced these needs themselves. The CHW role of serving as a bridge to agencies and services is similar in both rural and urban areas. He added that the resources that CHWs help their clients link up with often extend beyond health care resources. This is evident in another role that survey respondents and focus group participants described: addressing SDOH. Rather than focusing on one single area, CHWs fill in a variety of gaps, from addressing SDOH to navigating aspects of the health care system to providing links to wraparound services. The third role that emerged from the focus groups is that CHWs can provide insights about patients that might be missed by other health care providers. Not only do CHWs understand the communities they serve, they also enter the homes of patients, which provides the opportunity to glean critical holistic information about their patients\u2019 lives that may be affecting their health.\n\nCHWs are individuals who help bridge the gap between the public\u2014including the most vulnerable members of the community\u2014and the health and social services that are available, Callaghan explained. CHWs are distinct from many other health care providers in that CHWs often come from the communities in which they serve. Being a community member enables CHWs to promote trust within the community and connect vulnerable individuals to the services they need. He noted that the literature on CHWs as well as anecdotal personal experiences demonstrate that CHWs often possess unique cultural competence and a personal understanding of their communities and their patients, which equips CHWs to help those patients overcome barriers to accessing health care services. The CHW workforce is growing rapidly, he added. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that the CHW workforce would increase by up to 13 percent between 2018 and 2028. 15 In Texas, the number of CHWs in the field has increased by more than 500 percent in just the past few years ( Callaghan et al., 2019 ).\n\nTimothy Callaghan from the Southwest Rural Health Research Center at Texas A&M University focused his presentation on the role of the CHW in addressing the needs of rural Americans and the unique barriers they face in accessing health services. He presented data to define CHW roles, explored differences between CHWs in urban and rural environments, highlighted challenges in the growing CHW field, and described CHW efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTelehealth Mental Health Services During the Pandemic Morris asked about the role of telehealth services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014particularly the delivery of mental health services for youth and older adults. Calac replied that at the Indian Health Council facility where he works, the behavioral health wing continues to serve clients at nearly the same capacity (roughly 90 percent) of pre-pandemic levels through the use of telehealth services for both adult and pediatric client populations. He noted that a disadvantage of delivering mental health services through telehealth, especially for pediatric patients, is that it limits the amount of observation data that a clinician can collect. However, telehealth sessions have the benefit of allowing the clinician to observe pediatric clients in their home environments, which is helpful for behavioral health services. The patient response to the shift to telehealth has been varied, added Calac. Some individuals are frustrated by the platforms and by the limited capacity in some areas. Creative efforts have been made to address these issues by using nonsecure platforms that patients may be more familiar with (e.g., FaceTime, Zoom) in between scheduled sessions. Other clients enjoy being in their home environment for telehealth appointments because the setting feels less formal, he noted.\n\nRural Health Care Financing Challenges Morris asked about the types of research that may be needed to determine which hospitals are at the highest risk of closure, about the role of the COVID-19 pandemic in determining that risk, and about long-term improvements that are needed beyond basic reimbursement changes and pilot programs. Moore responded that financially fragile systems are vulnerable because they lack reserves, so any disruption can heavily impact vulnerable entities. The stressors that came with the pandemic, like canceled outpatient procedures, had an immediate negative effect on the finances of rural facilities. He explained that these types of facilities generally are not structured to provide a high volume of inpatient services, so their budgets are often based on outpatient procedures that may constitute 60 to 80 percent of their total business. At the same time that rural facilities were seeing a decline in patients, urban areas were working to handle surges in patients with COVID-19, noted Moore. Consequently, underutilized rural hospitals were identified in some discussions as a potential resource to meet the increased need for medical care. Although these rural hospitals may be underutilized for elective and preplanned procedures, the surge capacity in rural hospitals might quickly disappear as individuals requiring hospital care for COVID-19 in rural areas would still require the nearest ER. Moore was also concerned about the possible underreporting of COVID-19 cases in rural areas and the potential for rural health systems to exceed their capacity if rural regions experience the type of escalations in case numbers that were initially seen in urban centers. Moore added that long-standing disparities have become more prominent as the COVID-19 pandemic has begun to put additional stress on systems. Rural facilities already tend to have limited resources, and because smaller health facilities are often at the tail end of the supply chain, it is unclear whether health facilities will have the capacity to respond to a surge of COVID-19 cases in rural areas. Calac remarked that the COVID-19 outbreak in the Navajo Nation in Arizona highlights the need for better processes around emergency preparedness in the future. He added that the pandemic affects different tribes in different ways, so improved processes and preparedness will need to be tailored to their specific settings. For instance, California has a general population of 33 million people and is home to more than 60 tribal entities, so an effective outbreak response in that state will look different than the response in Arizona. Regions in close proximity to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border also face setting-specific challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, it has been difficult to translate and implement social distancing policies in border towns in Texas, where hospitals have seen an influx of patients from across the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. Similarly, southern San Diego County has a much higher COVID-19 infection rate than northern San Diego County, suggesting that proximity to the border may exacerbate certain challenges faced by communities affected by COVID-19. Menachemi contended that 70\u201380 percent of all of the challenges in the U.S. health care system stem from chronic underfunding and chronic underappreciation for public health, which put a strain on vulnerable facilities. He suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic may present a critical opportunity to rethink decades-old challenges in public health\u2014even if it means political fallout for some leaders\u2014and to implement holistic changes to the health care system at large. Morris remarked that issues of structural urbanism, rural hospitals, hospital closures, and pick-your-provider services all relate to the central issue of health financing. Small tweaks in financing or health systems, such as increasing reimbursement by a small percentage, will not adequately address the situation. Menachemi agreed and responded that tweaking reimbursement within current structures would not be sufficient, as \u201creimbursement\u201d implies medical care reimbursement rather than health care reimbursement. He added that the United States does a much better job at providing medical services than keeping people healthy or preventing diagnosed diseases from becoming more severe. He suggested that the concept of health should be infused into the way society perceives health care, because many people think of health care merely as better medical care, but an insurance card does not solve life problems that are exacerbating one\u2019s health issues; it only helps patients cope better with the health issues they have, and it is not the most cost-effective method of promoting health, he added. Callaghan said the current paradigm of the health care system is focused on profit maximization, which will continue to lead to more problems in rural areas. When profit maximization is the goal, rural areas are at a disadvantage because health care work in rural areas is typically less profitable than operating large urban hospitals. Callaghan suggested incentive structures need to be changed so that both health needs and the SDOH are addressed. He predicted that given current conditions and the trends of hospital closures, the health of rural communities will likely worsen owing to factors such as the need to travel longer distances for care.\n\nCoordinating Care in Rural Areas Morris questioned whether better use of wraparound services and CHWs could help ensure that care is coordinated, especially after people traveling long distances for specialty care return to their rural communities. Although his presentation focused on licensed or credentialed individuals, Menachemi clarified that CHWs certainly fit the definition of wraparound service providers. With the shortage of traditional wraparound service providers in rural areas, CHWs who are already working as generalists could feasibly be quickly trained to do the jobs that a half dozen professionals would perform in settings with more resources. However, he cautioned that this is a \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d in that rather than building a health care workforce of highly trained individuals in rural areas, CHWs with less training become even more overburdened. This could perpetuate the problems of structural urbanism, he added. Callaghan noted a debate in the CHW community over training and education. Many CHWs say they do not want additional training and education, because they value being a part of the community and feel that training would shift them from being a community member to being an \u201cother.\u201d This gives rise to the question of whether additional training and education would affect the way patients relate to CHWs. He added that the effective provision of wraparound services in rural communities\u2014for rural patients who have transferred home from large urban hospitals, for example\u2014requires the type of robust coordination of care and communication between urban and rural health providers that is not commonplace."

            "extracted_text": "Access to healthcare services is critical to good health, yet rural residents face a variety of access barriers. A 1993 National Academies report, Access to Healthcare in America, defined access as \u201cthe timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes.\u201d A 2014 RUPRI Health Panel report on rural healthcare access summarizes additional definitions of access with examples of measures that can be used to determine access.\n\nIdeally, residents should be able to conveniently and confidently access services such as primary care, dental care, behavioral health, emergency care, and public health services. Access to healthcare is important for:\n\nOverall physical, social, and mental health status\n\nDisease prevention\n\nDetection, diagnosis, and treatment of illness\n\nQuality of life\n\nAvoiding preventable deaths\n\nLife expectancy\n\nRural residents often encounter barriers to healthcare that limit their ability to obtain the care they need. Access to healthcare implies that healthcare services are available and obtainable in a timely manner. Even when an adequate supply of healthcare services exists in the community, there are other factors that may impede healthcare access. For instance, to have healthcare access, rural residents must also have:\n\nFinancial means to pay for services, such as health or dental insurance that is accepted by the provider\n\nMeans to reach and use services, such as transportation to services that may be located at a distance, and the ability to take paid time off of work to utilize services\n\nConfidence in their ability to communicate with healthcare providers, particularly if the patient is not fluent in English or has limited health literacy\n\nTrust that they can use services without compromising privacy\n\nConfidence that they will receive quality care\n\nThis guide provides an overview of healthcare access in rural America, including the importance and benefits of healthcare access as well as the barriers that rural residents experience. The guide includes information regarding:\n\nBarriers to care, including workforce shortages, health insurance status, transportation issues, health literacy, and stigma in rural communities\n\nAccess issues for specific populations and healthcare services\n\nStrategies and resources to improve access\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow does the lack of healthcare access affect population health and patient well-being in a community?\n\nThe supply of primary care providers per capita is lower in rural areas compared to urban areas, according to Supply and Distribution of the Primary Care Workforce in Rural America: 2019 [not currently available online]. Travel to reach a primary care provider may be costly and burdensome for patients living in remote rural areas, with subspecialty care often even farther away. These patients may substitute local primary care providers for subspecialists or they may decide to postpone or forego care. If patients do not have access to primary care or subspecialty care, they may use emergency department (ED) services for their healthcare needs. According to the 2024 article Non-Urgent Use of Emergency Departments by Rural and Urban Adults, 16% of rural adults compared to 13% of urban adults reported ED visits, and 5% of rural adults used the ED for a non-urgent reason compared to 4% of urban adults.\n\nAccording to the 2014 RUPRI Health Panel report, Access to Rural Health Care - A Literature Review and New Synthesis, barriers to healthcare result in unmet healthcare needs, a lack of preventive and screening services, challenges in the treatment of chronic diseases, and even a reduced lifespan. While access to medical care does not guarantee good health, access to healthcare is critical for a population's well-being and optimal health.\n\nThe challenges that rural residents face in accessing healthcare services contribute to health disparities. To learn more about disparities in health outcomes, see the Rural Health Disparities topic guide.\n\nWhat are barriers to healthcare access in rural areas?\n\nDistance and Transportation\n\nRural populations are more likely to have to travel long distances to access healthcare services, particularly subspecialist services. This can be a significant burden in terms of travel time, cost, and time away from the workplace. In addition, the lack of reliable transportation is a barrier to care. In urban areas, public transit is generally an option for patients to get to medical appointments; however, these transportation services are often lacking in rural areas. Rural communities often have more elderly residents who have chronic conditions requiring multiple visits to outpatient healthcare facilities. This becomes challenging without available public or private transportation. The Transportation to Support Rural Healthcare topic guide provides resources and information about transportation and related issues for rural communities.\n\nWorkforce Shortages\n\nHealthcare workforce shortages impact healthcare access in rural communities. One measure of healthcare access is having a regular source of care, which is dependent on having an adequate healthcare workforce. Other indicators, such as measures of nonuse that count rural residents who could not find an appropriate care provider, can further provide estimates of whether a sufficient healthcare workforce is available to rural residents. See What state-level policies and programs can help address the problem of shortages in the rural healthcare workforce? on the Rural Health Workforce topic guide for more information.\n\nA shortage of healthcare professionals in rural areas of the U.S. can restrict access to healthcare by limiting the supply of available services. As of September 2024, 66.33% of Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) were located in rural areas. For the most current numbers, see the Health Resource and Services Administration's (HRSA) Designated Health Professional Shortage Areas Statistics. HRSA also includes statistics on mental health and dental HPSAs.\n\nPrimary Care HPSAs are scored 0-25, with higher scores indicating a greater need for primary care providers. This April 2025 map highlights nonmetropolitan areas with primary care workforce shortages, with areas in darker green indicating higher nonmetro HPSA scores:\n\nFor more information on workforce challenges, resources, and strategies used to address rural healthcare workforce shortages, see the Rural Healthcare Workforce topic guide.\n\nHealth Insurance Coverage and Cost\n\nIndividuals without health insurance have less access to healthcare services. According to Geographic Variation in Health Insurance Coverage: United States, 2022, nonmetropolitan children and adults under 65 were more likely than their metropolitan peers to be uninsured.\n\nUninsured Population by Urbanization Level, 2022 Adults, ages 18-64 Children, ages 0-17 Large central metropolitan 13.9 3.9 Large fringe metropolitan 10.1 4.0 Medium/small metropolitan 12.2 4.0 Nonmetropolitan 13.9 5.5 Source: Geographic Variation in Health Insurance Coverage: United States, 2022\n\nThe cost of healthcare can be an access barrier, and KFF reports that in 2022, 43% of adults postponed medical care for themselves or a household family member due to cost. This issue is often exacerbated in rural areas, with 12% of rural adults reporting they or a family member had difficulty paying medical bills, compared to 10% of urban adults. The 2023 policy brief, Rural Working-Age Adults Report More Cost Barriers to Health Care, states that rural working adults are more likely than their urban counterparts to report issues with paying medical bills or delaying care because of the cost. However, the cost of healthcare is an issue for both rural and urban residents.\n\nHealth insurance affordability is a concern for rural areas. A RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis policy brief, Nonmetropolitan Premiums, Issuer Participation, and Enrollment in Health Insurance Marketplaces in 2022, evaluated unsubsidized and net-of-subsidy marketplace (HIM) plan premiums in 2022. Average premiums were higher in rural counties than in urban counties. In addition, rural counties were more likely to have fewer than 3 firms participating in the HIM. Medicare Advantage plan co-pays and deductibles are higher in rural, and no-cost benefits like health clubs and transportation are less frequently offered in rural areas. According to Changes in Marketplace Premiums and Insurer Participation, 2022-2023, rural areas tend to have fewer insurers and little competition among them, which can result in higher premiums.\n\nBroadband Access\n\nWhile the use of telehealth services was already becoming more popular and widespread at the beginning of 2020, measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this growth. Unfortunately, many areas lack access to broadband internet and experience slow internet speeds, both of which are barriers to accessing telehealth services. According to Computer and Internet Use in the United States: 2021, 9.0% of urban households did not have a broadband subscription, compared to 13.4% of rural households. To learn about additional challenges for rural telehealth use, see What are the challenges related to providing telehealth services in rural communities? on the Telehealth and Health Information Technology in Rural Healthcare topic guide.\n\nHealth Literacy\n\nHealth literacy can also be a barrier to accessing healthcare. Health literacy impacts a patient's ability to understand health information and instructions from their healthcare providers. This can be especially concerning in rural communities, where lower educational levels and higher incidence of poverty often impact residents. Low health literacy can make residents reluctant to seek healthcare due to fear or frustration related to communicating with a healthcare professional. Additionally, navigating the healthcare system can be difficult without health literacy skills. To learn more about low health literacy in rural America, see the Rural Health Literacy Toolkit in our evidence-based toolkits. The Rural Monitor's 2017 two-part series on rural health literacy, Understanding Skills and Demands is Key to Improvement and Who's Delivering Health Information? explores connections between health and health literacy and how health information is being delivered to rural populations. The Rural Monitor's 2022 two-part series, A New Era of Health Literacy? Expanded Definitions, Digital Influences, and Rural Perspectives and Educating Future Healthcare Providers: Health Literacy Opportunities for Webside Manners explores health literacy in the digital era.\n\nSocial Stigma and Privacy Issues\n\nIn rural areas, because there is little anonymity, social stigma and privacy concerns are more likely to act as barriers to healthcare access. Rural residents can have concerns about seeking care for mental health, substance use, sexual health, pregnancy, or even common chronic illnesses due to unease or privacy concerns. Patient discomfort may be due to personal relationships with their healthcare provider or others working in the healthcare facility. Additionally, patients can feel fear or concerns about other residents, who are often friends, family members, or co-workers, who may notice them utilizing services for health conditions that are typically not openly discussed, such as counseling or HIV testing services. The 2024 article Identifying Challenges and Solutions for Improving Access to Mental Health Services for Rural Youth: Insights from Adult Community Members discusses stigma and barriers to mental healthcare in rural areas. Co-location or the integration of behavioral health services with primary care healthcare services in the same building can help ease patient concerns. Community programming that promotes positive mental health can destigmatize mental healthcare, and access to telemental health services may help alleviate privacy issues.\n\nWhy is primary care access important for rural residents?\n\nPrimary care, in addition to emergency care and public health services, is an essential rural healthcare service. Primary care providers offer a broad range of services and treat a wide spectrum of medical issues. The American Academy of Family Physicians characterizes primary care as follows:\n\n\u201c[\u2026] primary care includes health promotion, disease prevention, health maintenance, counseling, patient education, diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses in a variety of health care settings\u2026A primary care practice serves as the patient's entry point into the health care system and as the continuing focal point for all needed health care services.\u201d\n\nA 2005 Milbank Quarterly article, Contribution of Primary Care to Health Systems and Health, identifies the key roles primary care access plays in preventing disease and improving health. Primary care serves as a first entry point into the health system, which can be particularly important for rural residents, who might otherwise face barriers to accessing healthcare. Some benefits of primary care access are:\n\nPreventive services, including early disease detection\n\nCare coordination\n\nLower all-cause, cancer, and heart disease mortality rates\n\nReduction in low birth weight\n\nImproved health behaviors\n\nImproved overall health\n\nLower healthcare costs\n\nRural Healthy People 2030 discusses how residents with limited primary care access may not receive preventive screenings that can lead to early detection and treatment of disease, as well as missing opportunities for behavioral healthcare screening and initiation. A 2019 University of South Carolina Rural Health Research Center findings brief, Identification of High-Need Rural Counties to Assist in Resource Location Planning for Primary Care [not currently available online] states that 279 rural counties did not have an FQHC or RHC and 72 of those counties were isolated from primary care safety net providers. To learn more about FQHCs, see the Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) topic guide. Additionally, the Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) topic guide answers frequently asked questions on these types of facilities and provides information and resources.\n\nFor more information on primary care in rural and urban areas, see Primary Care in the United States: A Chartbook of Facts and Statistics from the Robert Graham Center.\n\nWhat types of healthcare services are frequently difficult to access in rural areas?\n\nHome Health\n\nHome health services in rural America are a growing need but can be difficult to access for some rural residents. A 2022 University of South Carolina Rural Health Research Center findings brief [not currently available online] indicates that 10.3% of all rural ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) were not served by any home health agency, with frontier and remote areas having the least access to home healthcare. Home is Where the Heart Is: Insights on the Coordination and Delivery of Home Health Services in Rural America, a 2017 Rural Health Reform Policy Research Center policy brief, covers many barriers and challenges facing rural home health agencies that affect their ability to provide access in rural areas, including:\n\nReimbursement and insurance coverage\n\nFace-to-face requirement\n\nHomebound status requirement\n\nChanging rules and regulations\n\nWorkforce\n\nTime and resources required to serve patients located at a distance\n\nDischarge process and referral difficulties\n\nSee To what extent are home health services available in rural communities? on the Rural Home Health Services topic guide for more information.\n\nHospice and Palliative Care\n\nHospice and palliative care agencies often face barriers and challenges similar to other healthcare services in rural areas. These challenges can include workforce shortages, recruitment and retention programs, reimbursement issues, limited access to broadband, and others.\n\nThe Rural Hospice and Palliative Care topic guide answers frequently asked questions and provides resources on hospice and palliative care in rural areas. Community-based Palliative Care: Scaling Access for Rural Populations, a 2018 Rural Monitor article, describes the role palliative care plays in meeting the needs of patients who are chronically and seriously ill and covers challenges to accessing palliative care in rural areas. For more information on palliative care in rural areas, see the 2024 WWAMI Rural Health Research Center policy brief Palliative Care Challenges and Solutions in Rural U.S. Communities [not currently available online].\n\nMental Health Services\n\nAccess to mental health providers and services is a challenge in rural areas. As a result, primary care providers often fill the gap and provide mental health services. However, primary care providers may face challenges that limit their ability to provide mental health care access, such as inadequate financial reimbursement or lack of time with patients.\n\nRural communities face shortages in mental healthcare providers. As of September 2024, 61.85% of Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas were located in rural areas. For the most current figures, see HRSA's Designated Health Professional Shortage Areas Statistics.\n\nMental Health HPSAs are scored 0-25, with higher scores indicating a greater need for mental health providers. The April 2025 map below highlights mental health HPSAs for both metro areas, in multiple shades of purple, and nonmetro areas, in various shades of green.\n\nThe 2023 report, Rural Health Research Recap: Rural Behavioral Health Workforce, summarizes research from Rural Health Research Centers that show how rural counties have fewer social workers, psychologists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and counselors when compared to urban counties.\n\nDue to the lack of mental health providers in rural communities, the use of telehealth to deliver mental health services is increasing. By using telehealth delivery systems, mental health services can be provided in a variety of rural settings, including rural clinics, schools, residential programs, long-term care facilities, and individual patient homes. Additionally, the Calendar Year (CY) 2022 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule made permanent the ability for FQHCs and RHCs to be reimbursed by Medicare for telemental health appointments. The Telehealth and Health Information Technology in Rural Healthcare topic guide has many more resources on how telehealth can improve access to care. For additional resources on access to mental health services in rural areas, see the Rural Mental Health topic guide.\n\nSubstance Use Disorder Services\n\nDespite a growing need, there is a shortage of substance use disorder services offered in many rural communities across America.\n\nMedically managed withdrawal is an initial step of substance use disorder treatment that involves managing acute intoxication and withdrawal as well as minimizing medical complications. The lack of withdrawal management providers in many rural areas creates a barrier to care that could result in patients forgoing or delaying needed treatment. In lieu of a withdrawal management provider in a rural community, the local emergency room or county jail, although not the most appropriate location for withdrawal management services, must often serve as a substitute. The 2024 article Rural\u2013Urban Differences in Out-of-Network Treatment Initiation and Engagement Rates for Substance Use Disorders reports similar issues, showing that there are lower rates of substance use treatment initiation and engagement in rural areas compared to urban areas.\n\nAccess to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) as well as medications for treating alcohol use disorder (MAUD) is also limited in rural communities. What's MAT Got to Do with It? Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder in Rural America provides an overview of using MOUD as part of evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder, with information on the science behind the disorder and how 3 medications for opioid use disorder (Buprenorphine, Methadone, and Naltrexone) work. According to Practical Tools for Prescribing and Promoting Buprenorphine in Primary Care Settings, rural areas benefit from using the drug buprenorphine for MOUD treatment, but often face staffing, transportation, and technology constraints that prevent making MOUD a viable option in rural communities. This publication provides recommendations to improve access, such as leveraging non-physician staff for treatment and engaging the local community to build service locations as strategies to overcome barriers. In addition, the publication suggests: \"Prescribe buprenorphine products that patients can use at home or over extended periods of time to support patients who face barriers related to traveling. Home induction is a feasible and safe method of initiating buprenorphine treatment for many patients.\"\n\nA shortage of mental health and substance use disorder clinicians in rural communities led to the development of new models to bridge the gap and provide needed mental health and substance use disorder services using allied behavioral health workers. Some examples include:\n\nThe Substance Use and Misuse in Rural Areas and Rural Response to the Opioid Crisis topic guides provide information and resources, answer frequently asked questions, and list model programs to address substance use disorder and model programs to address opioid use in rural areas.\n\nReproductive, Obstetric, and Maternal Health Services\n\nReproductive healthcare is typically more difficult to access in rural areas. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation's (KFF) issue brief, Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Services: Key Findings from the 2020 KFF Women's Health Survey, rural women are less likely to have had a recent pap test and less likely to have access to a provider who discussed reproductive health issues with them, such as contraception, sexual and relationship history, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other transmissible diseases, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and menopause.\n\nAccess to obstetric services is a persistent, but growing concern in rural areas. A 2022 Center for Economic Analysis of Rural Health policy brief, County-Level Availability of Obstetric Care and Economic Implications of Hospital Closures on Obstetric Care, reports that out of 148 counties that lost obstetric services between 2012 and 2019 due to hospital or unit closures/conversions, 113 of the counties were rural. Additionally, a 2020 action plan from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy Women, Healthy Pregnancies, Healthy Futures: Action Plan to Improve Maternal Health in America, points out that, although 15% of people in the U.S. live in rural communities, only 6% of OB/GYNs serve these areas. However, many rural family physicians provide broad OB/GYN services to their patients.\n\nA 2020 case study Making it Work: Models of Success in Rural Maternity Care discusses 3 rural obstetric service providers, highlighting the importance of strong partnerships, collaboration, and community support to maintaining successful rural maternity care. The Rural Maternal Health Toolkit also discusses access to maternity care in rural areas.\n\nThe 2019 National Rural Health Association (NRHA) policy brief, Access to Rural Maternity Care, provides an overview of the decline in access to maternity care in rural areas and factors contributing to the decline in access. The brief offers policy considerations to support maternity care services and address barriers to access in the rural U.S., such as increasing research funding, rural OB practice challenges, workforce issues, and quality of OB care. The report Restoring Access to Maternity Care in Rural America discusses strategies to improve maternal care, such as creating maternity care networks, promoting visibility for care, helping rural providers care for patients with high-risk pregnancies, utilizing telemedicine, expanding and training the rural healthcare workforce, enlisting nonclinical partners, and more. For more information on rural maternal health issues and strategies to address them, see the Rural Maternal Health topic guide.\n\nOral Health Services\n\nOral health can affect overall physical and emotional health. For example, oral health needs that are not addressed can lead to pain or cosmetic concerns that can affect academic or professional success. Despite the importance of oral health, access to dental care is either very limited or difficult to access in many rural and remote communities.\n\nTraditionally, health insurance plans have not covered oral health services. A separate dental insurance plan is needed to cover oral health services and procedures. According to the 2021 National Institutes of Health report Oral Health in America, fewer rural residents have dental insurance compared to urban residents.\n\nAnother factor limiting access to dental services is the lack of dental health professionals in rural and underserved areas. As of September 2024, 66.70% of Dental Health Professional Shortage Areas were located in rural areas. For the most current numbers, see HRSA's Designated Health Professional Shortage Areas Statistics. According to 2020-2021 HRSA Area Health Resource Files, there are 7.5 dentists per 10,000 citizens in metropolitan areas and 4.7 dentists per 10,000 citizens in nonmetropolitan areas. The lack of dental professionals in rural areas can lead to poor oral health in rural residents.\n\nDental Health HPSAs are scored 0-26, with higher scores indicating a greater need for dental health providers. This April 2025 map highlights nonmetropolitan areas with dental health workforce shortages, with areas in darker green indicating higher nonmetro HPSA scores:\n\nA May 2018 NRHA policy brief, Improving Rural Oral Healthcare Access, offers recommendations to address dental workforce shortages and to ultimately improve access to oral health services, including:\n\nProviding rural training tracks during dental education\n\nAdmitting dental students from rural areas who would be more likely to practice in a rural community\n\nProviding dental students opportunities to obtain a broad range of dental skills which will be needed in a rural practice\n\nHelping rural communities recruit and retain oral health providers through local community development programs\n\nFor more information, see What oral health disparities are present in rural America? on the Oral Health in Rural Communities topic guide.\n\nHow do rural healthcare facility and service closures impact access to care?\n\nThe closure of rural healthcare facilities or the discontinuation of services can have a negative impact on access to healthcare in rural communities. Local rural healthcare systems are often fragile; when one facility closes or a provider leaves, it can impact care and access across the community. For example, if a surgeon leaves, C-section access declines and obstetric care is jeopardized. If a hospital closes, it may be harder to recruit physicians.\n\nThere are multiple factors that can affect the severity and impact of a hospital or healthcare facility closure on healthcare access, including:\n\nDistance to the next closest provider\n\nAvailability of alternative services\n\nTransportation services\n\nCommunity members' socioeconomic and health status\n\nTraveling to receive healthcare services places the burden on patients. For individuals with low incomes, no paid time off from their jobs, physical limitations, acute conditions, or no personal transportation, these burdens can significantly affect their ability to access healthcare services.\n\nHospital closures create access issues for rural residents. A 2015 findings brief from the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program, A Comparison of Closed Rural Hospitals and Perceived Impact, identifies the following potential impacts on healthcare access due to hospital closure:\n\nUnstable health services, particularly diagnostic and lab tests, obstetrics, rehabilitation, and emergency medical care\n\nRising EMS costs\n\nResidents not receiving needed care or services due to lack of transportation\n\nGreater impact on access for the elderly, the poor, people with disabilities, and other groups in need\n\nThe North Carolina Rural Health Research Program maintains an interactive map that displays locations of rural hospital closures in the U.S. from January 2005 to present. According to the map, 106 rural hospitals have completely closed since 2005, and 86 have converted to a different form of healthcare facility. Unfortunately, rural health experts believe rural hospital closures are likely to continue because many rural hospitals have minimal operating margins with little room for financial loss. For a summary of hospital closure data, see Rural Hospital Closures: 2023 Update [not currently available online].\n\nA significant concern for rural communities losing their hospital is the loss of emergency services. In emergency situations, care delays can have serious adverse consequences on patient outcomes. Alternative models and provider types may be needed to meet access needs in rural areas in the event of closures. A 2016 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission presentation, Improving Efficiency and Preserving Access to Emergency Care in Rural Areas, describes policies and strategies to ensure access to emergency department services in rural areas. The presentation provides discussion on alternative healthcare delivery models. The 2020 research brief, Alternatives to Hospital Closure: Findings from a National Survey of CAH Executives, explores options to maintain access in rural communities whose hospitals are encountering negative profit margins. Starting in 2023, converting to a Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) is an option for rural hospitals as an effort to maintain some emergency services in rural areas. For more information, see the Rural Emergency Hospitals topic guide.\n\nAdditional closures impacting rural areas can be seen in nursing homes in nonmetropolitan counties. Trends in Nursing Home Closures in Nonmetropolitan and Metropolitan Counties in the United States, 2008-2018 shows that in this time span 472 nursing homes closed in 400 nonmetropolitan counties and as of 2018, 10.1% of rural counties in the U.S. were considered nursing home deserts. According to Nursing Home Closures and Trends: June 2015 - June 2019, the impact of closure is significant for rural communities, who have fewer options for nursing home care and rely on healthcare facilities as centers for employment. Nursing Home Closures and Access to Post-Acute Care and Long-Term Care Services in Rural Areas states that rural areas experiencing closures have longer distances to travel to the next available nursing home offering post-acute care, an average of 6.4 miles compared to 0.94 miles for urban areas. The article shows similar results for long-term care services, with 7.2 miles of travel for rural areas and 1.1 miles for urban areas.\n\nMaintaining pharmacy services in rural towns can also be a challenge, particularly when the only pharmacist in town nears retirement. When a community's only pharmacy closes, it creates a void and residents must adapt to find new ways to meet their medication needs. According to Causes and Consequences of Rural Pharmacy Closures: A Multi-Case Study [not currently available online]:\n\n\u201cRural residents rely on local pharmacies to provide pharmacy and clinical care management and coordination. The absence of a pharmacy may be disproportionately felt by the rural elderly, who often have a greater need for access to medications and medication management services.\u201d\n\nA 2024 data brief from RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis, Changes in Rural Pharmacy Presence 2023, describes rural communities that lost pharmacy services between 2018 and 2023:\n\n20.5% of the population was aged 65 and older\n\nUnemployment was at 3.9%\n\nUninsured rates were 9.2%\n\n17.8% were impoverished\n\n17.6% were living with a disability\n\nThe 2024 article, Locations and Characteristics of Pharmacy Deserts in the United States: A Geospatial Study, states that locations considered pharmacy deserts are more likely to have a population with lower educational attainment, have lower rates of insurance coverage, fewer English-speaking residents, more residents with an ambulatory disability.\n\nA 2022 RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis Brief states: \u201cBetween 2003 and 2021, the number of retail pharmacies declined in noncore rural areas by 9.8 percent, and in rural micropolitan areas by 4.4 percent, while the number in metropolitan areas increased by 15.1 percent during the same period.\u201d For more information on rural pharmacy access or challenges rural pharmacies face, see the Rural Pharmacy and Prescription Drugs topic guide.\n\nWhat are some strategies to improve access to care in rural communities?\n\nThere are multiple strategies being used to improve access to healthcare in rural areas. Examples include:\n\nDelivery Models\n\nIn 2023, a new Medicare provider type was implemented, the Rural Emergency Hospital, which is designed to maintain access to emergency and outpatient care in rural areas. For more information, see the Rural Emergency Hospital topic guide.\n\nCommunity Paramedicine is a model of care in which paramedics and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) operate in expanded roles to assist with healthcare services for those in need without duplicating available services existing within the community. The Community Paramedicine topic guide describes how this model of care can benefit rural communities and covers steps to starting a rural community paramedicine program. Rural communities looking to develop community paramedicine or mobile integrated health programs can also view the Rural Community Paramedicine Toolkit for emerging practices and resources.\n\nThe Community Health Worker (CHW) model facilitates healthcare access by using CHWs as a liaison between healthcare providers and rural residents to ensure their healthcare needs are met. The Community Health Workers in Rural Settings topic guide offers information and resources on CHWs and covers CHW education, training, and certification.\n\nCare coordination and team-based care models, such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMHs), can also extend access to primary care services in rural communities. A variety of rural medical home and care coordination programs are highlighted in the Rural Health Models and Innovations section.\n\nAffiliation with Larger Systems or Networks\n\nLocal rural healthcare facilities may choose to join healthcare networks or affiliate themselves with larger healthcare systems as a strategic move to maintain or improve healthcare access in their communities. These affiliations or joining of healthcare networks may improve the financial viability of the rural facility, provide additional resources and infrastructure for the facility, and allow the rural healthcare facility to offer new or expanded healthcare services they could not otherwise provide. However, the benefits of an affiliation with a larger healthcare system may come at the expense of local control.\n\nA 2018 RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis policy brief, Trends in Hospital System Affiliation, 2007-2016 [not currently available online], notes that rural hospitals do follow the general trend and show an increase in hospital system affiliation. The brief found nonmetropolitan CAHs had the lowest rate of increase in hospital system affiliation. The 2018 RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis report, The Rural Hospital and Health System Affiliation Landscape \u2013 A Brief Review [not currently available online], discusses the various types of hospital affiliations that rural hospitals might consider and factors that might affect which option rural hospitals choose, such as maintaining local decision-making authority and meeting the demands of the hospital system affiliation. The report covers some benefits hospital system affiliation can afford a rural hospital, including access to:\n\nTechnology\n\nStaff recruitment and retention\n\nGroup purchasing\n\nIncreased access to healthcare and operational services\n\nAbility to adapt to value-based payment models\n\nImproved performance\n\nFor facilities and providers who wish to remain independent, networks are a way to collaborate to create economies of scale and work toward mutual goals. Networks allow for the sharing of resources, group purchasing, and shared services, among other activities. Clinically integrated networks (CINs) are complex organizations that extend their collaborations into the clinical realm, creating efficiencies and quality care by working together and holding each other accountable to achieve mutual goals. For more information on these strategies, see the Rural Monitor article, Better Together: Rural Hospital High-Value Networks.\n\nEfforts to Improve the Workforce\n\nAn adequate workforce is necessary for maintaining healthcare access in a community. In order to increase access to healthcare, rural communities must use their healthcare professionals in the most efficient and strategic ways. This might include allowing each professional to work at the top of their license, using new types of providers, working in interprofessional teams, and creative scheduling to offer clinic time outside of regular work hours. The 2024 report Access to Health Care in Rural America: Current Trends and Key Challenges features a variety of federal workforce programs that address healthcare workforce issues in rural communities. The Rural Healthcare Workforce topic guide discusses how rural areas can address workforce shortages, such as partnering with other healthcare facilities; increasing pay for staff; adding flexibility and incentives to improve recruitment and retention of healthcare providers; and using telehealth services. The guide also discusses state and federal policies and programs to improve the supply of rural health professionals, such as loan repayment programs and visa waivers.\n\nTelehealth\n\nTelehealth is considered to be a key tool to help address rural healthcare access issues. Through telehealth, rural patients can see subspecialists in a timely manner while staying in the comfort of their home or local facility. Local healthcare providers can also benefit from subspecialists' expertise provided via telehealth. However, there is the potential for unequal access to these services due to a lack of broadband internet access in some rural areas. The 2022 article Geospatial Analysis of Access to Health Care and Internet Services in the US shows that though counties with internet access were positively correlated with more available healthcare access, rural counties had less internet availability and were more likely to be situated in a healthcare desert. According to the Federal Communications Commission 2020 Broadband Deployment Report, 22.3% of rural Americans and 27.7% of Americans living in tribal areas lack fixed terrestrial broadband coverage, compared to 1.5% of Americans who lack coverage in urban areas.\n\nAn additional concern is the potential that access to telehealth services may supplant, rather than support, primary and subspecialist care in hard-to-reach areas, causing unintended consequences to healthcare facilities in rural areas. Financial Effects of Remote Product Delivery: Evidence from Hospitals draws attention to this concern, discussing issues such as loss of patient volume and financial burdens in rural hospitals due to distant providers acquiring rural patients through telehealth. Improving healthcare access in rural areas requires a balance of telehealth options and sustainable in-person healthcare.\n\nFor more information on telehealth policy, including broadband infrastructure, see the Rural Policy Research Institute's 2023 report, The Role of Telehealth in Achieving a High Performing Rural Health System: Priorities in a Post-Pandemic System. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has a telehealth guide that is specific to rural areas as well as a telehealth policy page that provides the most recent information on telehealth policy.\n\nThe Telehealth and Health Information Technology in Rural Healthcare topic guide provides a broad overview of how telehealth is being used in rural communities to improve healthcare access. The guide covers specific programs currently in use in rural areas, as well as providing resources and a listing of funding and opportunities that can be used to support telehealth solutions.\n\nWhat can be done to help rural veterans access healthcare?\n\nOne of the primary barriers that rural veterans face when accessing healthcare services is the significant travel distance to the nearest Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare facility. A 2018 study found that rural veterans' access to healthcare is not necessarily an issue of eligibility for purchased care from non-VA providers, as most VA healthcare facility deserts also have shortages of non-VA providers. The 2024 U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing, Frontier Health Care: Ensuring Veterans' Access No Matter Where They Live, discusses issues related to rural veteran healthcare access, such as staffing, broadband, distance to healthcare providers, and more.\n\nAccording to the 2019 research brief Access to Care Among Rural Veterans, 56% of rural veterans enrolled in the VA health system are over 65 years of age and are more likely to experience diabetes, heart conditions, and high blood pressure compared to urban veterans. Moreover, suicide rates are higher for rural compared to urban veterans. It is important that populations with complex medical needs have access to support programs.\n\nTo address access issues for rural veterans, the VA has created community-based outpatient clinics in many rural areas, in addition to using mobile clinics and telehealth services. To learn more about VA services for rural veterans or the VA's efforts to address veterans' healthcare access, see the Rural Veterans and Access to Healthcare topic guide.\n\nWhat organizations work to improve rural healthcare access?\n\nMany organizations work to meet the needs of rural communities and help ensure the availability of essential healthcare services.\n\nHow are private foundations working to improve healthcare access and the related reimbursement issues?\n\nMany private foundations work to improve healthcare access by funding transportation services, improving workforce, and addressing other factors that affect rural healthcare access. Investing in existing safety net providers and programs, offering grants to develop and implement innovative healthcare delivery models, and funding research to study policy implications as they relate to rural healthcare access are all examples of actions foundations can take to support rural healthcare access.\n\nA 2017 article published in Health Affairs, Foundations' Efforts to Improve Rural Health Care, covers private foundation projects focused on improving access to rural healthcare.\n\nGrantmakers in Health offers multiple resources that provide education and guidance to foundations interested in improving rural healthcare access, such as Improving Health Care Access: Grantmakers Share Their Experiences and Improving Health Access in Communities, Lessons for Effective Grantmaking."

            "score": 0.7533401,
            "extracted_text": "This cross-sectional analysis utilized survey data collected as part of the larger ASPIRE Mayuge cervical cancer screening study [21,22,23]. The purpose of this sub-study was to investigate cellphone ownership and cellphone access in rural Uganda and to consider the implications for self-care, with a particular focus on cervical screening and cancer prevention. More than three-quarters (76.1%) of women surveyed owned their cellphone. The population surveyed is representative of other semiurban areas in LMICs and suggests that even in low-resource, remote settings, there may be high penetration of cellphones, making self-care with digital technology a potentially viable option.\n\nMore importantly, while attendance at a health center was high across all categories, women who owned or had access to a mobile phone lived closer to a health center compared to the no access group, suggesting a negative correlation between rurality and cellphone ownership. Regardless of access, the vast majority of women were receptive to the offer of receiving information about cervical screening via SMS if available, which suggests the feasibility of using digital technology to support cervical cancer prevention initiatives. This is consistent with the literature where, in a 2019 cluster-randomized trial, Huchko et al. found that women in rural Kenya preferred the use of mobile phone results notification over home visit results notification for cervical cancer screening [26]. Similarly, in a 2022 inquiry into the acceptability of text messages for cervical cancer screening in Tanzania, Lokke et al. observed support for educative and reminder text messages [27]. In a 2020 analysis of health outcomes from 15 countries including Uganda, LeFevre et al. found mobile phone ownership to be associated with increased odds of attending antenatal care clinic visits [28]. Initiatives that improve smartphone access in more rural areas, such as the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology and Innovation (MINICT)\u2019s ConnectRwanda Initiative, can significantly bridge urban\u2013rural gaps in access [29]. While mobile phone ownership may be a factor that facilitates access to services, we recognize that other factors may be confounding its impact on health service seeking.\n\nOver 7% of the surveyed women did not own a cellphone, nor had cellphone access. These women are likely the lowest SES group, as indicated by lower education, more total pregnancies, and further distance to health centers. Attention needs to be given to this subpopulation in particular when considering the adoption and implementation of self-care via digital technologies to avoid exacerbating any existing inequities. Rwanda\u2019s recognition of the potential for digital health technologies in health care has led to initiative ensuring all citizens are either provided a cellphone or able to access digital health self-care intervention through a village-appointed health worker. There must be similar provisions put in place in Uganda, at the health care system level, to ensure care is still accessible for those without the resources to participate in programs where self-care is centered around digital technology.\n\nAbout 17% of women surveyed had access to a cellphone that they did not own. It requires further investigation of women who lacked direct ownership of a cellphone, emphasizing the need to explore the dynamics and potential barriers associated with shared phone access, especially concerning health-related communications. In a Kenyan study, 55.2% of cellphone sharers felt comfortable receiving screening results via SMS versus 70.7% of cellphone owners, and those who did not own their cellphones were less likely to attend treatment [30]. These findings indicate that there are added barriers to the access group compared to the ownership group, in terms of attendance to follow-up. Unfortunately, the literature on the differences between cellphone access versus ownership in relation to self-care is limited and poorly defined.\n\nDespite the willingness to receive information on cervical cancer screening via text, most women in all groups had limited to no prior cervical cancer screening. This finding was also reported in a community-based cluster survey conducted by Twinomujuni et al. in 2015, where a low participation in screening was found despite a high intention to screen amongst women surveyed [31]. While women are responding favorably to testing and education on cervical cancer outcomes, these attitudes are not translating into practice towards screening. The low screening rates found in our analysis and the work conducted by Twinomujuni et al. are consistent with screening patterns in sub-Saharan Africa. Studies have found participation in cervical cancer screening to be 12.87% across sub-Saharan Africa, with a study in Eastern Uganda reporting a 4.8% screening rate [7, 32]. This demonstrates that other factors continue to impact the uptake of cervical cancer preventative services and suggest a need for further inquiry into interventions that address cervical cancer accessibility and availability issues in rural Uganda. Given the limited availability of healthcare resources in rural regions such as Malongo, future research could probe the potential impacts of mHealth interventions on screening uptake given the largely positive view of prevention in the region. By continuing inquiries that enable us to harness mobile technology to facilitate the uptake of screening and prevention measures, continuous progress towards the elimination of cervical cancer will be realized, both in Uganda and globally.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nThis research is strengthened by employing VHTs to administer the survey; this is shown to improve community partnerships, sustainability, and cultural sensitivity as participants deliver responses in their native language to a known and trusted member of the community [33]. However, the use of survey research is a limitation as it requires respondents to self-report responses. In addition, the survey was administered verbally by a VHT. Consequently, it is possible that recall bias or social desirability bias resulted in the misrepresentation of attitudes, knowledge, and experiences [34]. Further, the study population was recruited exclusively from Mayuge county and may not be generalizable across other LMIC regions. Finally, we had limited knowledge of the extent of mobile phone utilization by the women surveyed. As such, the assumption that mobile phone access translated to mobile phone use had to be made throughout the analysis. Further investigation into household income, type of phone (basic/non-internet phone versus smartphone), usage patterns, digital literacy, availability of electricity, and mobile credit for cellphone usage and upkeep, as well as frequency of use, is critical for future analyses."

            "extracted_text": "Abstract Telemedicine is the delivery of healthcare services from a distance, by use of information and communication technology. There have been no statutory regulations or official guidelines in India specific for telemedicine practice and allied matters so far. For the first time, the government of India released telemedicine practice guidelines for Registered Medical Practitioners on March 25, 2020, amid the COVID\u201019 outbreak. This review would initiate the discussion on the features of the guidelines, their limitations, and their significance in times of the COVID\u201019 pandemic. The guidelines are with a restricted scope for providing medical consultation to patients, excluding other aspects of telemedicine such as research and evaluation and the continuing education of healthcare workers. The guidelines have elaborated on the eligibility for practicing Telemedicine in India, the modes and types of teleconsultations, delved into the doctor\u2010patient relationship, consent, and management protocols, and touched upon the data security and privacy aspects of Teleconsultation. After releasing the guidelines, the telescreening of the public for COVID\u201019 symptoms is being advocated by the government of India. COVID\u201019 National Teleconsultation Centre (CoNTeC) has been initiated, which connects the doctors across India to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in real\u2010time for accessing expert guidance on the treatment of the COVID\u201019 patients.

No ha habido regulaciones legales o pautas oficiales en India espec\u00edficas para la pr\u00e1ctica de la telemedicina y asuntos relacionados hasta el momento. Por primera vez, el gobierno de India public\u00f3 pautas de pr\u00e1ctica de telemedicina para m\u00e9dicos registrados el 25 de marzo de 2020, en medio del brote de COVID\u201019. Esta revisi\u00f3n iniciar\u00eda la discusi\u00f3n sobre las caracter\u00edsticas de las gu\u00edas, sus limitaciones y su importancia en tiempos de la pandemia de COVID\u201019. Las pautas tienen un alcance restringido para brindar consultas m\u00e9dicas a los pacientes, excluyendo otros aspectos de la telemedicina, como la investigaci\u00f3n y la evaluaci\u00f3n y la educaci\u00f3n continua de los trabajadores de la salud. Las pautas han detallado la elegibilidad para practicar Telemedicina en India, los modos y tipos de teleconsultas, profundizado en la relaci\u00f3n m\u00e9dico\u2010paciente, consentimiento y protocolos de gesti\u00f3n, y tocado los aspectos de seguridad y privacidad de datos de Teleconsulta. Despu\u00e9s de publicar las pautas, el gobierno de la India aboga por la teleevaluaci\u00f3n del p\u00fablico para detectar s\u00edntomas de COVID\u201019. Se ha iniciado el Centro Nacional de Teleconsulta COVID\u201019 (CoNTeC), que conecta a los m\u00e9dicos de toda la India con el Instituto de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas de toda la India (AIIMS) en tiempo real para acceder a la orientaci\u00f3n de expertos sobre el tratamiento de los pacientes con COVID\u201019.\n\nINTRODUCTION Telemedicine uses electronic communication and information technology (IT) to support the delivery of healthcare services and medical education to people at a distant site, i.e., to those who are not able to reach the healthcare provider in person (Sood et al., 2007). It is a means to improve the health outcome in patients by providing them access to healthcare and healthcare information. The term \u201cTelemedicine\u201d coined in the 1970s means \u201cHealing at a distance\u201d literally (Strehle & Shabde, 2006). Telemedicine, in its current form, has a history from the later parts of the 19th century. A physiologist in the Netherlands, Willem Einthoven, made recordings of electrical cardiac signals of a patient more than a kilometer away with a string galvanometer by using the telephonic transmission (Barold, 2003). Over the years, telemedicine has been providing a myriad of services during natural calamities: remote monitoring of patients, educating the healthcare professions, establishing collaboration with the experts by linking the physicians and reducing the unnecessary cost incurred on transport and time for in\u2010person consultation for conditions that do not warrant it (Chellaiyan et al., 2019; Ryu, 2012) Telemedicine was introduced to India as a pilot project of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in 2001 by linking a well\u2010developed hospital (Apollo Hospital) in Chennai to a peripheral rural hospital in Andhra Pradesh (Indian Space Research Organisation, 2021). ISRO has been spearheading telemedicine in India and has paved the way for its operationalization from just being a technology demonstration. It brought the specialty healthcare services to the doorsteps of rural and remote areas using technology. Apollo Telemedicine Networking Foundation (ATNF) is one among the pioneers of telemedicine globally. Apollo TeleHealth is one of the largest telemedicine networks in south Asia. There were no official telemedicine guidelines in India till 2019. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) has boosted telemedicine in India in a huge way. The need for risk\u2010free contactless communications between physician and patient has also paved the way for the flourishment of several electronic applications (e\u2010applications) related to healthcare consultations worldwide like Amwell, Doctor on demand, MDlive and Babylon. In India, e\u2010applications like Practo, 1 mg and Lybrate have flourished. The government of India has also launched its telemedicine service, eSanjeevani (National TeleConsultation Service, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2020). eSanjeevani is the government of India's flagship web\u2010based national teleconsultation portal. During the first lockdown, eSanjeevaniOPD was rolled out by the government on April 13, 2020 (Press Information Bureau, Government of India, 2021). As specified by World Health Organization (WHO), the scope of telemedicine includes patient consultation, diagnosis, prevention and treatment as well as research and continuing education of healthcare workers (HCWs), provided the objective of such activities is advancing the health of individuals as well as the communities (Ryu, 2012). The services include but are not limited to teleradiology, teleophthalmology, telecardiology, telestroke, telepediatrics, teleconferencing, and teleclassroom. Specialized projects such as National rural telemedicine network, National medical college network, among the medical colleges across the country, and National Cancer Network (ONCONET) are being implemented in India (Chellaiyan et al., 2019). Individual medical institutes and hospitals also conduct telemedicine services for patients, link primary care centers or physicians (Chellaiyan et al., 2019). The principles and procedures for practicing telemedicine in India are taken from the international telemedicine guidelines and the statutes of India, like the Indian Medical Council (IMC) Act 1956, Information Technology (IT) Act 2000, Clinical Establishment Act 2010, Drugs & Cosmetics Act 1940, and so forth (Ateriya et al., 2018). However, there have been no dedicated statutory regulations or guidelines of any sort, specific for telemedicine practice and allied matters, in India. The issue came to the forefront when the Bombay High Court delivered a verdict against a doctor couple in a case of criminal negligence, wherein the physician made a prescription without a diagnosis over the telephone (Deepa Sanjeev Pawaskar And Anr vs. The State of Maharashtra on 25 July 2018, 2018). The telemedicine practice guidelines for Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs), Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani (ASU) practitioners and Registered Homeopathy Practitioners (RHPs) were issued by the Government of India on March 25, 2020, April 7 and April 10, 2020, respectively (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2020b). The elements and principles of ASUs and RHPs guidelines are almost the same as that of RMP guidelines, with the only difference being adherence to homeopathy and ASU regulations while practicing it. The timing is of particular interest, as it was immediately a day after the nationwide lockdown to contain COVID\u201019 was announced. Through this paper, we describe the guideline creation process as a matter of historical record, the scope of the newly released Indian telemedicine practice guidelines for RMPs and their significance during this pandemic as well as the framework for understanding modes and types of consultations. It will also offer a thorough analyses of medico\u2010legal aspects relevant to telemedicine under the guidelines.\n\nGUIDELINE CREATION PROCESS Guidelines have been prepared by the Board of Governors, created in a supersession to the Medical Council of India, in collaboration with NITI Aayog, the government think tank for planning and policymaking (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2020b). The Indian Medical Council code (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics Regulation, 2002) was amended by introducing clause 3.8 in 2020 by permitting telemedicine consultations by RMPs under the telemedicine practice 2020 guidelines in Appendix 5. The \u201cTelemedicine Practice Guidelines\u201d are added as \u201cAppendix 5\u201d to the 2002 regulations, as there are already four appendices. Following these guidelines, the Board of Governors, CCH also amended and adopted the \u201cTelemedicine Practice Guidelines\u201d for homeopathic practitioners on April 10, 2020 (The Board of Governors, Central Council of Homeopathy, 2021). Though the rationality for the guidelines is explicitly mentioned at the beginning of the document, it does not talk about the process and the experts involved in making it. The crucial aspect of stakeholder consultation with the RMPs, patients, technical platforms, and the medical institutes that already provide telemedicine services remains unanswered. Later a set of Frequently Asked Questions and their answers were released by the council (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2020a). The Technical groups worked, and the process involved in developing telemedicine guidelines has been a part of the guidelines in other countries (Intan Sabrina & Defi, 2021; Ministry of Health Singapore, 2015; National Initiative for Telehealth Guidelines, 2003; Province of BC Health Authorities, 2014) National initiative for telehealth guidelines was established in Canada to have a more comprehensive consultation and participative process to arrive on the recommendations for telehealth (National Initiative for Telehealth Guidelines, 2003).\n\nSCOPE OF THE GUIDELINES The areas and the context where it can be used have been spelled out (Ryu, 2012). The guidelines are with a restricted scope for providing medical consultation to patients, excluding other aspects of telemedicine such as research and evaluation, the continuing education of HCWs, and complex teleinterventions like robotic surgeries. Hence, the guidelines' title could have been \u201cTeleconsultation Practice Guidelines\u201d as it aptly reflects the scope of the guideline rather than the \u201cTelemedicine Practice Guideline.\u201d It also specifies the jurisdiction of the guidelines as applicable only for services provided in India. It outlays the broad principles and the seven elements essential to have teleconsultation (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2020b). The commitment and flexibility to update the guidelines as and when required has been provided, similar to other countries (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2015). Singapore has comprehensive guidelines encompassing the details of organizational structure and equipment required to provide telemedicine, including instruments like the stethoscope, and technological support required while providing telemedicine services, which has not been included in Indian guidelines (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2015). The guidelines developed by the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) is also of comprehensive nature, and is regularly updated based on critical evaluation and feedback. ATA is a non\u2010profit organization with complete focus only on advancing telehealth and has been in action since 1999. WHO has acknowledged 15 Cross\u2010border legalities involved in the Telemedicine service provisions (Ryu, 2012). On June 11, 2020, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) issued guidelines advising insurers to allow telemedicine wherever consultation with a medical practitioner is allowed in the conditions of the policy contract. With these critical inclusions, the practice of telemedicine became legitimized and moved out of the regulatory gray space. Later, in May 2020, telepsychiatry operational guidelines were released jointly by the Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS), Telemedicine Society of India (TSI), and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) (Indian Psychiatric Society & Telemedicine Society of India In collaboration with National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, 2020). In the telepsychiatry versus Mental healthcare act 2017, areas of concern or conflict such as maintenance of records, informed consent, advance directive, and person's rights with mental illness have been addressed (Duffy & Kelly, 2019). This guideline gives practical advice to psychiatrists for incorporating telepsychiatry services as a part of regular day\u2010to\u2010day clinical practice. The prescription of psychiatric medicines is also an area of concern. List O and A drugs can be prescribed during the first consultation through video consultation only. However, drugs such as Zolpidem and Lorazepam fall under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act ambit and hence not to be prescribed online (Indian Psychiatric Society & Telemedicine Society of India In collaboration with National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, 2020). The psychiatrist can convey an online Prescription to an RMP or a HCW via collaborative teleconsultation. List B drugs can be prescribed in telefollow\u2010up consultation only, while a prohibited list of drugs cannot be prescribed online.\n\nMODES AND TYPES OF CONSULTATION The modes of communication, such as audio, video, and text, are permitted to be utilized in the teleconsultation process. The consultation can be between the patient and RMP, RMP and RMP, and health worker and RMP, thus providing space for assistance, expert opinions, and real\u2010time linkages for referral during the teleconsultation. It also allows for asynchronous consultation, wherein the availability of patients and RMPs for a real\u2010time teleconsultation may not coincide. The consultation has also been categorized as the first consult and follow up consult. In case the patient is consulting for the first time with an RMP for a current condition or the patient has consulted for the same health condition more than six months ago or the patient has consulted for a different health condition earlier, then the consultation is called as first consultation (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2020a, 2020b; Dinakaran et al., 2020) On the other hand, follow up consultation is defined as the patient's consultation with RMP within six months of the previous in\u2010person consultation for the same health condition. In case of the presence of new symptoms which are not in the same health condition, it is not considered a follow\u2010up. Similarly, in case of failure of RMP to recall the previous consultation context and treatment, it is not considered a follow\u2010up consultation (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2020a, 2020b; Dinakaran et al., 2020). The guideline also paves the way for the caregiver or HCWs to interact with RMPs or facilitate the patient consultation and consultation between two RMPs when an expert opinion or referral is deliberated. According to the guidelines, every consult, whether first or follow\u2010up, shall be undertaken only after confirming the absence of any condition requiring emergency care (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2020b). South Africa's telemedicine guidelines have minimal scope allowing only a video consult and the presence of a consulting health provider in person with the patient for examination, while expert assistance or opinion is provided by service consultant remotely (Health Professions Council of South Africa, 2020). It is similar to that of telecollaboration (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2015). Prescription of list A drugs for the new consultation requires a video consultation. Also, there is a lack of knowledge about current technology platforms among people, including HCWs, which might hinder effective communication.\n\nMEDICO\u2010LEGAL ASPECTS The identification details of the patient and the RMP must be established and verified before initiating the medical consultation. The possible mechanism to ensure and verify each other's identity has been spelled out in the guidelines (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2021). Physician\u2013patient relationship The decision to manage the specific condition in teleconsultation or otherwise is left to the professional judgment of the RMP. Conversely, if a patient prefers in\u2010person consultation over teleconsultation, the same cannot be forced upon him (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2020b). The guidelines take a balanced approach in managing the patient preferences and professional caliber of the RMP. Thus, it provides for shared decision making between the patient and the healthcare provider in terms of utilizing the services. All records of the patient consultation shall be maintained similar to the in\u2010person consultation. This is in line with the practices outlined in the recommendations of other countries (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2015; Province of BC Health Authorities, 2014). The third party (applications or platforms) could have access to the audio and video recordings of the teleconsultation between the doctor and patient. There needs to be a way to address the issues arising out of private data leaks in public. Consent, professional ethics and data security The concept of informed consent has been included as an essential element in teleconsultation. Implicit or implied consent is taken if the patient initiates the teleconsultation. An explicit consent in words understood by the patient must be obtained if the RMP initiates the consultation, and the same must be mentioned in patient records (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2021). Countries around the world have an informed consent obligation to conduct telemedicine services (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2015; National Initiative for Telehealth Guidelines, 2003; Province of BC Health Authorities, 2014; Telemedicine laws and developments: A state\u2010by\u2010state analysis, 2014). The RMP shall adhere to all the professionals\u2019 ethics and conduct established under the Indian Medical Council (IMC) Act and regulations (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2021; The Board of Governors, Central Council of Homeopathy, 2021). Data security shall be maintained in accordance with the Information Technology (IT) Act of India (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2021). According to the IT Act, the patient's consent must be taken before collecting data from him/her (Ateriya et al., 2018). However, the specific clauses, obligations, and penalties pertaining to the informed consent for data and security breaches have not been provided in the guidelines. This, along with the lack of an accredited course to understand the nuances of telemedicine, may alienate a common RMP from exploring the teleconsultation services. Though the right to privacy has been held as a fundamental right and an integral part of the right to life by the apex court of India (Province of BC Health Authorities, 2014), the lack of specific data protection laws or rules as in the United States of America (USA) must also be acknowledged (Ateriya et al., 2018). The Personal Protection Bill, 2018, is yet to be made an Act, thus having gaps in privacy safeguards (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2015). The Consumer Protection Act (CPA) will be applicable for teleconsultation, as long as the consultation is charged by the RMP or the Institute (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2021). Explicit mention about CPA is missing in the guidelines. Diagnosis, treatment, and payments The RMPs can provide health promotion and prevention messages to the patient. The RMP must mention a diagnosis before the prescription in the teleconsultation (Ryu, 2012). The RMP enjoys the same discretion and accountability in diagnosing and prescribing medicines in teleconsultation as he does in the conventional in\u2010person consultation. However, there is a restriction or prohibition on the type of drugs prescribed through various modes of teleconsultation (Table 1) (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2021). Flexibility to alter the list by the competent authority is provided within the document. The RMP can charge fees for the teleconsultation similar to that of an in\u2010person consultation. Most of the states in the USA, such as Arkansas, Alabama, Arizona, etc., have their insurance system, Medicaid, reimburse the cost paid for all telemedicine by the patients, while states like Idaho pay for certain services like telepsychiatry (Telemedicine laws and developments: A state\u2010by\u2010state analysis, 2014). Even though the guidelines prohibit the advertisement of RMP's about their telemedicine services, the telemedicine platforms invariably tend to advertise or promote them indirectly about their consulting hours, fees, mode of payment etc. Table 1. Matrix of the permissible drug lists based on the type and mode of consultation List of medicines and its mode of teleconsultation Prescription mode (video/audio/text) Nature of consultation (first\u2010consultation/follow\u2010up) Medicines included List O: It will comprise those medicines which are safe to be prescribed through any mode of teleconsultation Any Any Over\u2010the counter medications Antipyretics: Paracetamol\n\nCough Supplements: Lozenges\n\nCough/Common\u2010cold medications (such as combinations of acetylcysteine, ammonium chloride, guaifensen, ambroxol, bromhexene, dextromethorphan)\n\nORS Packets\n\nSyrup zinc supplements: Iron and folic acid tablets, vitamin D, calcium supplements Medication given on emergency basis (notified by government of India) Example Chloroquine for Malaria List A: These medications are those which can be prescribed during the first consult which is a video consultation and are being re\u2010prescribed for re\u2010fill, in case of follow\u2010up. Video First consultation First consult medications Ointments/lotion for skin ailments: ointments clotrimazole, mupirocin, calamine lotion, benzyl benzoate lotion, etc.\n\nLocal ophthalmological drops such as: ciprofloxacillin for conjunctivitis, etc.\n\nLocal ear drops such as: clotrimazole ear drops, drops for ear wax, etc.\n\nFollow\u2010up consult for above medications Follow\u2010up medications (\u201cre\u2010fill\u201d) Hypertension: enalapril, atenolol, etc.\n\nDiabetes: metformin, glibenclamide, etc.\n\nAsthma: salmetrol inhaler, etc. List B: Is a list of medication which RMP can prescribe in a patient who is undergoing follow\u2010up consultation in addition to those which have been prescribed during in\u2010person consult for the same medical condition Any Follow up Follow\u2010up, medications prescribed as \u201cAdd\u2010on\u201d Example: hypertension: e.g., add\u2010on of Thiazide diuretic with atenolol\n\nDiabetes: addition of sitagliptin to metformin Prohibited list: An RMP providing consultation via telemedicine cannot prescribe medicines in this list. Not to be prescribed Not to be prescribed Drugs listed under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS), Act, 1985 and schedule X drugs Example: anticancer drugs, morphine, etc. Open in a new tab Training and registration of RMPs in telemedicine The person eligible to do the teleconsultation has been mentioned as RMPs, as defined under the IMC Act (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2020b; The National Medical Commission Act 2019, 2019; The Indian Medical Council, 2002). They should have also qualified in an online course on telemedicine within 3 years of the notification of the guidelines for legally practicing telemedicine. However, during the interim period, any RMP can practice teleconsultation by adhering to the principles and norms mentioned in the guidelines (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2021). This may be seen as a way to fast\u2010track the adoption of telemedicine by RMPs in India during the COVID\u201019 emergency situation. However, the non\u2010release of even a short course on telemedicine, along with the guidelines, is a point of contention. While it can be taken as a start, giving such a leeway to practice without an appropriate channel for instilling the principles of telemedicine, especially when issues of data security and personal data protection are there, may raise legal questions in a court of law. The state of Alabama in the USA mandates special licenses for telemedicine from physicians (Telemedicine laws and developments: A state\u2010by\u2010state analysis, 2021). Similar training and qualification are expected in Singapore to practice telemedicine (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2015).\n\nTELEMEDICINE PLATFORMS The guideline spells the responsibility of the platforms that facilitate telemedicine to ensure the authenticity and credentials of the RMP enlisted to provide the teleconsultation in their platform. Any violation of the norms by the firms may lead to their blacklisting (entities to be avoided or distrusted as being deemed unacceptable by the Medical Council of India or its successors (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2021). The technology platforms are supposed to appoint a grievance officer, as mentioned under the IT Act (Ateriya et al., 2018). But the current telemedicine guidelines leave it vague with a mention of \u201cproper mechanism\u201d to address the grievance or queries (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2021).\n\nLEGAL STATUS OF THE GUIDELINE Telemedicine has been given legal status in India (The gazette of india: extraordinary, 2020). On May 12, 2020, the government published the guidelines in the gazette (The Gazette of India: Extraordinary, 2020). The \u201cTelemedicine Practice Guidelines\u201d are included as \u201cAppendix 5\u201d to the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002\u2019. However, it is also clearly stated that these guidelines are not applicable for using digital technology to conduct surgical or invasive procedures remotely. Countries have issued telemedicine practice as guidelines (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2015), as well as statutory rules (Ateriya et al., 2018). European Union has taken multiple initiatives and directives to promote telemedicine, yet a common legal framework or a law still evades them (Raposo, 2016). A statute, Telehealth Advancement Act, 2012, is available for telemedicine in the USA (Ateriya et al., 2018).\n\nNATIONAL PORTABILITY AND THE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES The guideline allows an RMP to practice teleconsultation all over India, that is, national portability (Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2021). This breaks the boundaries by enabling doctors to provide services and patients to avail themselves of services in states other than their residential ones. However, there is no clarity on whether a medical council registration of the patient's state is required for the doctor to do the teleconsultation since all regulations and rules of in\u2010person consultation under IMC apply to teleconsultation. Also, the jurisdiction of state medical council on matters of professional misconduct and disciplinary action against the RMP in cases of inter\u2010state teleconsultation needs detailed clarifications. Health is a state subject in India. Hence the regulations of the state governments might be a potential hindrance in the practice of telemedicine.\n\nTELEMEDICINE IN RELATION TO COVID\u201019 SCENARIO COVID\u201019 pandemic is the catalyst for the release of guidelines on teleconsultation in India. Telescreening for COVID\u201019 symptoms, based on which patients can be referred to COVID\u201019 designated hospitals or other hospitals, is being recommended (Enabling Delivery of Essential Health Services during the COVID 19 Outbreak: Guidance note Background, 2021). The project COVID\u201019 National Teleconsultation Centre (CoNTeC) has been conceptualized by the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and has been implemented by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi (COVID\u201019 National Teleconsultation Center & AIIMS New Delhi, 2021). CoNTeC connects the doctors across the country to AIIMS in real\u2010time for the treatment of the COVID\u201019 patients, and doctors would be available in the facility 24 \u00d7 7 and to keep it functioning 24 h. Worldwide, there is a thrust towards telemedicine in this COVID\u201019 times. In the USA's response to coronavirus, due importance has been given for telehealth.(Koonin et al., 2020; Kichloo et al., 2020) Most insurance companies across the US are reimbursing teleconsultation for COVID\u201019 infection (The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2021).\n\nCONCLUSION Though the present guidelines released in India for telemedicine are not comprehensive, they could be taken as a starting point. They have initiated the attempt to legitimize the existing teleconsultation services provided in India appropriately. However, the limitations in terms of the restricted scope, lack of training material on telemedicine principles for RMPs, lack of a dedicated governance mechanism such as the National telemedicine agency, and the haziness over the jurisdictional authority of state medical councils over professional misconduct remain to be worked out. Further revisions and fine\u2010tuning of the guidelines addressing the above concerns should be taken up as the next step in the telemedicine governance of India.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS The authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.\n\nETHICS STATEMENT The article is a review paper on the guidelines available in the public domain.

            "extracted_text": "Telemedicine has brought a new dimension to healthcare and has been gaining popularity worldwide. However, the medico-legal aspects of the practice of telemedicine in India remain ambiguous to most doctors and administrators. We have therefore provided a concise overview of the legal aspects of telemedicine, which will enable doctors and administrators to provide better telemedicine services while safeguarding themselves from possible litigation.\n\nEditorial\n\nTelemedicine has been defined by the World Health Organization as \"the delivery of health care services using information and communication technologies for the exchange of valid information for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease and injuries, research and evaluation, and for the continuing education of health care providers, where distance is a critical factor\" [1]. Telemedicine has brought a new dimension to healthcare. While telemedicine has seen a steadily growing trend over the last decade, it has seen an unforeseen rise in users since 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. Telemedicine has several benefits, including increased access to care, lower overall costs, and high patient satisfaction rates [2]. It, however, raises issues pertaining to professional liability, confidentiality, credentialing, reimbursement, and the development of standards and infrastructure. Telemedicine has been gaining popularity in India too. However, the medico-legal aspects of the practice of telemedicine in India remain ambiguous to most doctors and administrators.\n\nThe law\n\nThere is currently no law in India specifically pertaining to telemedicine. While the Information Technology Act of 2000 dealt with information technology, it did not address issues in relation to healthcare. This has led several people to question the legality of telemedicine in India for decades. However, the absence of any law specifically for telemedicine should not be interpreted to mean that the practice of telemedicine is illegal in India. In March 2020, the Government of India released the \u2018Telemedicine Practice Guidelines\u2019 which have been incorporated as Appendix 5 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette, and Ethics) Regulation, 2002 [3].\n\nThis provides a framework for the practice of telemedicine. Some of the salient features of the guidelines are as follows:\n\nWho can practice telemedicine?: Any Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP) enrolled in the State Medical Register or the Indian Medical Register is permitted to provide telemedicine consultations. No special qualifications are required at present. The government, however, plans to introduce an online program in the future that will require completion to enable a RMP to practice telemedicine.\n\nIdentification of RMP, patient: Teleconsultations are not permitted to be anonymous. The RMP must identify himself along with his qualifications at the beginning of the consultation. The RMP must also explicitly verify the name, age, and identification of the patient.\n\nMode of telemedicine to be used: This has been left to the discretion of the RMP based on the complaints, the need for visual or audio interaction, the condition of the patient, and the available resources. If the RMP feels an in-person consultation is warranted, he reserves the right to recommend the same and proceed only after an in-person consultation.\n\nConsent: If a patient initiates the teleconsultation, consent is implied. If the RMP initiates a teleconsultation, consent has to be obtained from the patient. This explicit consent by the patient can be in the form of an email, a text message, or stating his intent over the phone or video.\n\nPrescribing medicines: It involves the same level of professional responsibility as face-to-face consultations. Prescribing medications without a provisional or appropriate diagnosis may be considered professional misconduct. Under telemedicine, the RMP (Registered Medical Practitioner) can prescribe certain medications, including common 'over-the-counter' medicines (list O drugs), relatively safe drugs with low abuse potential for first-time prescriptions (list A drugs), or for refills (list B drugs). However, the prescription of medicines listed in Schedule X of the Drug and Cosmetic Act and Rules or any Narcotic and Psychotropic substances listed in the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, is strictly prohibited (Prohibited List Drugs). The prescriptions must adhere to the standard rules outlined in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette, and Ethics) Regulations. Furthermore, every prescription must include the RMP's medical council registration number. The RMP is required to provide a photo, scan, digital copy of a signed prescription, or an e-prescription to the patient via email or any messaging platform [3].\n\nEthics and confidentiality: RMPs must adhere to the same principles of medical ethics, which include following professional standards to safeguard patient privacy and confidentiality, as stated in the IMC (Indian Medical Council) Act. This requirement applies not only to their clinical practice but also extends to their use of technological services. RMPs should exercise a reasonable level of caution when engaging in technological services to prevent any violation of patient privacy or confidentiality [3].\n\nMisconduct: Engaging in telemedicine against a patient's preference to visit a facility or have an in-person consultation, misusing patient images and data, or promoting telemedicine through advertisements would all be considered misconduct for RMPs. The penalties for such offenses will be in accordance with the IMC Act, professional ethics, and relevant laws, similar to any other form of professional misconduct [3].\n\nDocumentation: It is the responsibility of the RMP to maintain a record of the teleconsultation, patient records, and prescription records as required for in-person consultations.\n\nFees: RMP can charge an appropriate fee for the services. He has to provide a receipt or invoice for the fee charged to the patient.\n\nEmergencies: In the event of a medical emergency, the patient must be advised to have an in-person interaction with a RMP at the earliest. Guidance for first aid, counseling, and referrals are to be facilitated.\n\nHow the courts look at it\n\nThe fact that the \u2018Telemedicine Practice Guidelines\u2019 are guidelines and not laws does not mean they are not legally binding. The judiciary and legislature recognize the nascent nature of legal issues pertaining to telemedicine and have therefore provided the framework in terms of \u2018guidelines\u2019 that need to be followed until further legislation and laws are formulated and passed. At this time, there have been only a handful of case judgments related to telemedicine in Indian Courts.\n\nIn the case of Deepa Sanjeev Pawaskar and Another Vs State of Maharashtra, a postnatal woman visited the hospital where she had delivered a day earlier, with complaints of severe vomiting. She was examined only by a nurse and admitted. The doctor advised for medicines through a telephone conversation with the nurse [4]. Treatment advice was given only through telephone conversation. The patient\u2019s condition later deteriorated, and the patient unfortunately passed away, with the cause of death being determined to be pulmonary embolism. The Bombay High Court held the doctor negligent for having prescribed medicines through the telephone without having gained all the necessary medical information and for prescribing medicine without arriving at a diagnosis.\n\nIn the recent high-profile case involving the death of late actor Sushanth Singh Rajput, the prescription of clonazepam to him by a doctor came under contention in court after it was claimed that the drug was procured through a teleconsultation [5]. However, with clonazepam being listed on the prohibited list, the alleged procurement of the drug was deemed illegal, citing the Telemedicine Practice Guidelines.\n\nTo conclude, the legal framework for telemedicine in India is still evolving. The latest guidelines for 2020 still do not address matters relating to the use of remotely operated invasive or surgical procedures or the use of telemedicine for research purposes. It also does not specify its applicability for consultations with RMPs or patients outside the jurisdiction of India. With the increasing use of telemedicine, the laws guiding it will need to evolve and become more robust as well."

Using telehealth to reach patients in non-healthcare settings, outside of medical facilities, can be critical to overcoming persistent barriers to care, including lack of access to transportation and stigma associated with seeking help for a condition. The stay-at-home orders and physical distancing requirements implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of using telehealth to expand access to care outside of traditional healthcare settings.\n\nRural communities have implemented or expanded telehealth programs in several different types of nontraditional settings:\n\nHomes\n\nWorkplaces\n\nSkilled nursing facilities and other long-term care facilities\n\nSchool-based health centers\n\nCorrectional facilities\n\nThere are two key types of telehealth applications used for engaging and reaching patients in nontraditional settings:\n\nLive-video telehealth \u2013 Instead of traveling to a clinic to meet with a provider via telehealth, patients use a device such as a tablet, computer, or smartphone to receive care at home or at another convenient location. For example, Greater Oregon Behavioral Health, Inc. offers patients access to a telehealth platform that they can access from their personal devices. Patients can schedule appointments and meet with mental health specialists via live-video telehealth from their home, work, or other location of their choice.\n\n\u2013 Instead of traveling to a clinic to meet with a provider via telehealth, patients use a device such as a tablet, computer, or smartphone to receive care at home or at another convenient location. For example, Greater Oregon Behavioral Health, Inc. offers patients access to a telehealth platform that they can access from their personal devices. Patients can schedule appointments and meet with mental health specialists via live-video telehealth from their home, work, or other location of their choice. Remote patient monitoring technology \u2013 Remote patient monitoring helps providers assess the health status of a patient from a distance and helps patients manage their own health. Remote patient monitoring technologies typically collect information about physiological characteristics and vital signs, such as weight and blood pressure. For example, a patient who has cardiovascular disease may use a blood pressure cuff that transmits readings to a data repository. The patient's care team can review the monitoring data to track the patient's progress and, if necessary, intervene before any issues get worse. Other examples of remote patient technologies used in rural areas include telehealth-enabled scales, glucometers, pedometers, and pulse oximeters.\n\nBoth live-video telehealth and remote patient monitoring programs may involve the use of mobile health (mHealth) applications and technology. mHealth includes devices such as smartphones and tablets as well as software applications that patients can download onto devices. For example, the Veterans Health Administration launched the Anywhere to Anywhere initiative to increase access to home-based care for veterans with limited access to care, including veterans living in rural communities. Anywhere to Anywhere uses the VA Video Connect smartphone application to connect veterans to providers.\n\nRural communities are using several strategies to increase access to care in non-healthcare settings as well as improve patient engagement in care:\n\nCare transitions and post-acute care \u2013 Telehealth technology can be used to increase patient and family engagement in care transitions. For example, one rural program uses telehealth technology to communicate with young patients and their families after discharge from the hospital setting. Tablet technology is used to connect the patient and their family to the inpatient care team through telehealth calls. This program implemented TeamSTEPPS\u00ae to create a standardized communication system. An evaluation of this program found high patient engagement and patient satisfaction with communication via telehealth technology.\n\n\u2013 Telehealth technology can be used to increase patient and family engagement in care transitions.

Rural hospitals may also use home-based care to overcome capacity issues. The Hospital-at-Home model helps rural patients access different types of care and treatments in their homes.\n\nExamples of Rural Telehealth Programs for Engaging and Reaching Patients in Different Settings\n\nAlaska Veterans Telehealth and Biofeedback Services uses mHealth technology to offer veterans access to a stress-reduction training via biofeedback to address trauma.

ImPACT Online is a telehealth-based intervention for young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The telehealth component is a website for parent education. The pilot found high levels of parent engagement and satisfaction with the telehealth program.\n\nImplementation Considerations\n\nConsiderations for Live-Video Telehealth\n\nConnectivity may be an issue for rural programs seeking to offer access to live-video telehealth in home settings. To address limited access to broadband in rural Oregon, the Direct to Patient Tele-Behavioral Health Services program offers a text-based option for behavioral therapies. Patients without access to internet services may find it easier to connect with providers through text messages.\n\nConsiderations for Remote Patient Monitoring Technologies\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption and use of remote patient monitoring technologies, partly due to the relaxation by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) of some regulations related to remote patient monitoring during the public health emergency. The Center for Connected Health Policy tracks federal and state Medicaid reimbursement policies for remote patient monitoring. Rural programs may benefit from building partnerships with private payers and state Medicaid programs to discuss benefits of using telehealth to better engage patients in monitoring chronic health conditions. For example, a payer could be willing to fund a pilot remote patient monitoring program with the goal of decreasing hospitalizations for diabetes-related complications.\n\nIn order to achieve the best possible outcomes from remote patient monitoring, rural program staff may need to carefully consider how to integrate data from these technologies into clinical workflows. For example, staff may find it burdensome to consistently log on to a separate database to review monitoring data. To address this issue, some remote patient monitoring programs integrate data directly into electronic health records and create alerts when predetermined threshold values are exceeded. Rural practices may also need to develop protocols to instruct staff how to respond to abnormal data readings, such as reaching out to patients and caregivers by phone or video conference.\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic TRC's Remote Patient Monitoring Toolkit offers an interactive overview of the role of executives, providers, nurses, and technicians in implementing and sustaining a remote patient monitoring program.\n\nConsiderations for Patient and Family Engagement\n\nTelehealth can be applied to increase patient and family engagement in healthcare, but it is important for programs to recognize the potential implications for the patient and family. For example, video technology provides healthcare providers with a view into the patient's home and their living conditions. Additionally, the administration and management of technology may place additional burdens on some patients and families.\n\nAdditional implementation considerations including licensing and reimbursement are discussed in Module 4: Implementation and Module 6: Funding & Sustainability.\n\nProgram Clearinghouse Examples\n\nResources to Learn More\n\nHealth IT Patient Engagement Playbook\n\nWebsite\n\nGuidebook for healthcare providers, hospital administrators, and healthcare staff offering recommendations and best practices on using health information technology (HIT) with patients.

The study by PubMed explains, \"studies consistently highlight the need to test various telehealth programs in specific communities to validate which models are most effective.\" This will help ensure your program addresses some of the most pressing health disparities in the locations you\u2019re trying to research.\n\nRegister for our upcoming webinar with Dr. David Shalowitz: How Physician to Physician Collaboration Impacts Outcomes for Rural Communities\n\nCreate a patient engagement strategy\n\nTelehealth can involve multiple touch points and communication channels, including video conferencing, text messages, phone calls, and mobile apps. Work with your patients, providers, and other key stakeholders to determine which channels make the most sense for your telehealth program and the best way to integrate them into your strategy.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also important to ensure patients know how to use and engage with telehealth. Make sure you have the right support staff, help materials, and technology in place so that patients can join and participate in their telehealth appointment without a hitch.\n\nWork with communities to address the digital divide\n\nDespite the exemplary growth in the number of people accessing the internet over the years, there still remains approximately 3.5 billion people worldwide today who have no internet access. A huge percentage of these people are located in less developed countries and more particularly in the rural areas where the infrastructure development is very poor.\n\nAccess to virtual care and telemedicine relies on a reliable internet connection, yet nearly 1 in 5 rural Americans still lack access to broadband. To ensure telehealth is able to serve patients in these communities, health systems need to work with policymakers, community stakeholders to close this gap and ensure access to care by increasing affordability and taking steps to build the necessary infrastructure.\n\nWork with your specialists\n\nRural patients are particularly underserved when it comes to access to specialist care \u2013 including radiology, cardiology, pulmonology, and neurology. A telehealth program presents a huge opportunity for those specialists to expand their reach and for patients to benefit from the care they provide.\n\n\n\nWork with your specialists to get their buy-in around the telehealth program and make it as easy as possible for them to use. You should also collaborate with your marketing team to find opportunities to extend your brand around remote specialty care. This will help ensure that the populations you\u2019re trying to reach know your program exists.\n\nMake collecting medical records easy\n\nIn a rural setting where re-running medical tests and scans requires a greater amount of effort n the patient and the providers part, collecting and organizing patient medical records is essential to running a telehealth program. However, doing so can be challenging without the right technology infrastructure. Consider investing in cloud-based software that makes it easy for patients to upload their medical records, organize them into a digestible package, and share them with their providers before their telemedicine appointment.\n\nRural populations in the United States are up against significant health disparities. However, hospitals and health systems can help to reduce those disparities and drive greater health equality in these communities by leveraging telehealth.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister for our upcoming webinar: How Physician to Physician Collaboration Impacts Outcomes for Rural Communities"

            "extracted_text": "India\u2019s healthcare sector has seen considerable growth in recent years, with advancements in medical technology and infrastructure. Yet, rural healthcare continues to face significant challenges, ranging from insufficient medical facilities to a dire shortage of healthcare professionals.\n\n\n\nCurrent rural health landscape\n\nAs per the National Library of Medicine, the rural population of India is around 716 million people (72%) and yet there is a chronic lack of proper medical facilities. This glaring disparity underscores the pressing need to focus on rural healthcare and address the unique challenges faced by these communities. The treatments available in rural areas are quite expensive, less affordable for rural residents, and may cause a delay in treatment as well as death. Many of these inequities in rural healthcare result from a wide range of social, economic, and political circumstances or factors that differentially affect the distribution of health within a population.\n\n\n\nPressing health concerns in rural areas\n\n\n\nChronic Illnesses on the rise: Rural populations suffer disproportionately from chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Contributing factors include limited access to healthcare, higher rates of smoking and alcohol use, and a lack of preventive care. The absence of early diagnosis and timely intervention often leads to severe health outcomes.\n\n\n\nMental health crisis: Rural communities are increasingly experiencing mental health challenges, including depression and anxiety. Social isolation, economic hardships, and the societal stigma surrounding mental health prevent many from seeking the help they need. A lack of mental health services further aggravates the issue.\n\n\n\nSubstance abuse concerns: Substance abuse is a growing problem in rural India, where limited access to treatment programmes and the stigma attached to addiction discourage individuals from seeking help. Without adequate support and resources, substance abuse rates continue to rise in these communities.\n\n\n\nWomen and paediatric issues: Rural women and children face significant health risks due to limited access to prenatal care, skilled birth attendants, and postnatal services. This often leads to higher rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, and malnutrition.\n\n\n\nRising risk of infectious diseases: Rural populations are more susceptible to infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, due to high dominance of factors like poor sanitation, lack of clean water, and inadequate healthcare access.\n\n\n\nUrgent need for rural healthcare reforms\n\nIn rural areas, medical treatments are often unaffordable, and limited access to timely care can result in delayed treatments and preventable deaths. A range of social, economic, and political factors also contribute to the unequal distribution of healthcare resources in rural regions, exacerbating the issue.\n\n\n\nGeographic isolation: Vast distances between rural settlements and urban centres create significant obstacles for accessing specialised healthcare facilities. This often leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment, particularly for time-sensitive conditions.\n\n\n\nShortage of healthcare professionals: Rural areas grapple with a severe shortage of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and specialists. The uneven distribution of healthcare workers, with the majority concentrated in urban areas, further widens the healthcare gap between rural and urban India.\n\n\n\nHealth awareness and education: Health literacy levels in rural communities are often lower than in urban areas, leading to challenges in disease prevention, health promotion, and early intervention. Limited access to health education and awareness programmes contributes to preventable health issues and delayed medical seeking behaviour.\n\n\n\nCultural barriers: Cultural beliefs and practices in rural regions heavily restrict access to quality healthcare. Traditional beliefs about illness and treatment usually discourage people from seeking medical attention, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\n\nRole of health experts in addressing rural health issues\n\n\n\nPractitioner doctors play a pivotal role in addressing rural health issues and improving healthcare delivery in underserved communities. Their contributions are multifaceted and encompass the following areas:\n\n\n\nPrimary healthcare provision: Practitioner doctors serve as the frontline healthcare providers in rural areas, delivering essential medical care, conducting health screenings, and managing common health conditions. Their presence is crucial in addressing the immediate healthcare needs of rural populations.\n\n\n\nCommunity engagement and health promotion: Health experts engage with local communities to raise awareness about preventive healthcare measures, disease management, and healthy lifestyle practices. By conducting health camps, organising educational workshops, and collaborating with community leaders, practitioner doctors can empower rural residents to take charge of their health.\n\n\n\nTelemedicine and technology adoption: In remote rural areas where access to specialist care is limited, practitioner doctors can leverage telemedicine and technology to bridge the healthcare gap. Through teleconsultations, remote monitoring, and tele-education initiatives, health experts can extend their reach and provide specialised care to rural patients.\n\n\n\nCapacity building and training: Health experts play a crucial role in building the capacity of local healthcare providers, including paramedical staff, community health workers, and traditional healers. By sharing their expertise and knowledge, practitioner doctors can enhance the overall quality of healthcare delivery in rural settings.\n\n\n\nThe way forward\n\nAddressing these challenges will require substantial investment in rural healthcare infrastructure, an increase in the number of healthcare professionals in underserved areas, and targeted efforts to reduce social and economic barriers to care. The government should start investing in the development of rural healthcare infrastructure, including primary healthcare centres, hospitals, and diagnostic facilities. Training and retaining qualified healthcare professionals, including practitioner doctors, is crucial to ensure adequate healthcare coverage in rural areas. This can be achieved through targeted scholarship programmes, rural service obligations, and improved working conditions.\n\n\n\nCommunity health workers can also play a primary role in bridging the gap between healthcare providers and rural communities. They can provide health education, assist in diagnosis, and facilitate access to healthcare services. Furthermore, increased collaborations between government and private sector organisations can help mobilise resources, enhance service delivery, and improve healthcare outcomes in rural areas.\n\n\n\nPolicy and infrastructure support\n\nPolicymakers and healthcare authorities must actively prioritise the development of rural healthcare infrastructure, including the establishment of well-equipped primary health centres, mobile medical units, and telemedicine hubs. Additionally, policies aimed at improving living conditions, access to clean water, sanitation, and nutrition can significantly impact the overall health outcomes of rural communities.\n\n\n\nThe Government of India has launched several policies like the Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, Ayushman Bhav Campaign, National Rural Health Mission, etc. along with a few initiatives like Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission by harnessing the power of technology to uplift the rural healthcare status and to minimise the quality healthcare delivery between urban and rural communities.\n\n\n\nEmpowering local solutions\n\nThe National Health Mission aims to engage local stakeholders, including community leaders, village councils, and grassroots organisations, and is imperative in tailoring healthcare solutions to the specific needs of rural populations. By involving the community in decision-making processes and programme implementation, health experts can ensure that interventions are culturally sensitive and sustainable.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s healthcare system cannot thrive without addressing the urgent needs of its rural population. The focus must now shift to ensuring equitable access to healthcare services across the country. Practitioner doctors are indispensable in addressing these pressing health issues in rural India. Their presence in rural communities provides essential primary healthcare services, improves accessibility, and promotes health awareness. With comprehensive efforts from the government sectors and private healthcare units and a determined commitment to equity, it is possible to bridge the rural-urban healthcare divide and ensure that all Indians have access to quality healthcare, regardless of their geographic location and other socio-economic barriers.\n\n\n\n(Author is CEO of Jehangir Hospital, Pune)"

            "extracted_text": "The urban-rural divide in India\u2019s healthcare ecosystem\n\nIndia\u2019s rural communities face a significant shortage of healthcare facilities. Less than 25 per cent of the country\u2019s healthcare facilities are concentrated in rural areas where 64 per cent of the population resides. This gap has led to significant disparities in important health indicators in rural vs urban areas. For instance, on average, people living in India\u2019s rural regions can die up to 5 years earlier than urbanites.\n\nDespite the rise of urbanisation, more than half of India\u2019s population is projected to be rural by 2050. The rural economy constitutes 46 per cent of national income, a huge contributor to India\u2019s economy. It is of utmost importance to bridge the healthcare gap through sensitive design that respects the climate and culture of the region; allows qualitative, affordable and inclusive access for the most vulnerable and impoverished populations; encourages sustenance through equitable development and human resource augmentation; and allows scalability of holistically comprehensive and compassionate Community Healthcare Centres (CHCs).\n\nThe rural-urban divide is considerable when it comes to healthcare access. Attempts to correct these systemic deficiencies through the National Rural Health Mission and the National Health Policy have largely resulted in improving overall mortality rates over the past few years, especially with the maternal mortality rates reduced by 77 per cent as compared to the global 44 per cent ensuring target goals of the United Nations\u2019 2030 SDG 3: Good Health & Well Being for All. According to Rural Health Statistics (2020), there is an average shortfall of 38 per cent in CHCs. This number highlights the opportunity and need to create a healthcare blueprint that is an antithesis to the typical fear-inducing, white, sterile spaces that hospitals are infamous for.\n\nResponding to systemic building challenges in rural areas through an architecture that can heal\n\nHospitals are complex, multifaceted entities where various stakeholders closely work together to create an integrated, service-infused facility. The availability of human resources, infrastructure, water, and power in the region, accessibility of the location, and timely allocation of funds are some of the major factors that impact the development of hospitals in rural areas. The planning model should be committed to dignifying design that creates a transformative impact and inculcates a sense of compassion, empathy, inclusion, and acceptance for all users. Additionally, in rural areas, hospitals should also facilitate the region\u2019s economic and infrastructural growth. Prioritising local capacity building and sustainable practices in healthcare infrastructure can help us achieve this goal, shaping elegant, innovative, and cost-effective solutions.\n\nThe design must focus on creating a calm healing environment that enables easy recuperation and nurtures the holistic well-being of all users, both physical and emotional. Enhancing the connection with nature, integrating art into the premises, and creating spaces that support healthy social interactions are some ways of doing this. Efficient planning that ensures ease of external and internal navigation at various levels, supporting the streamlined movement of varied user groups, is also critical.\n\nSpatial programming to ensure local needs\n\nDemographics can often define regional healthcare\u2019s functional and programmatic needs. The clubbing of maternal and child care schemes in the National Health Policy is aimed at creating better resource synergies and hopefully better outcomes. Mother and Child Care departments with labour and waiting rooms, delivery rooms, and neonatal intensive care units fulfil a critical demand pertinent to rural healthcare. Designing the Mother and Child Care unit prototype sensitively in harmony with nature can transform the experience of \u201cwaiting\u201d for childbirth into an empowering act.\n\nOne of the most successful model case studies is the 150- bed Butaro District Hospital in Rwanda, Africa. It is developed to provide both in- and outpatient services, with a particular emphasis on maternal health. Creating a model of high-quality infrastructure that can be easily adapted to the context and needs of the individual project can have a transformative effect on the way health infrastructure is developed globally.\n\nZoning to ensure efficient circulation\n\nEfficient planning is important for ensuring that patients and visitors feel non-intimidated and can easily navigate through critical clinical and non-clinical spaces. In healthcare facility design, \u2018Liminal Gaps,\u2019 referring to transitional spaces like waiting areas, corridors, entryways, staircases, and balconies, play a crucial role in shaping the overall experience, influencing movement and interaction within the immediate environment. Thoughtful design of these transitional spaces enhances the sense of arrival, provides opportunities for rest and reflection, and facilitates wayfinding for patients and visitors. One way to ease wayfinding is to implement a consistent colour scheme in the flooring throughout all nonclinical circulation corridors. This can provide a clearly perceivable pathway to guide user movement across the building\u2019s various zones.\n\nFostering belonging and facilitating connection for emotional well-being through climate resiliency and cultural sensitivity\n\nClimate and culture can be strong collaborators in defining the design ethos for a rural healthcare facility and ensuring it meets the needs of the community it serves. One can strive to design environments that harness sunlight and channel wind not only for thermal comfort but also to reduce the rate of spread of infections and nurture people\u2019s relationship with nature for comfort and well-being. Building orientation is key to indoor comfort. Building alignment should enable maximum north-facing critical and non-critical patient areas with ample glare-free natural light. Through thoughtful design, such as planning for non-clinical and non-critical clinical spaces to be naturally ventilated, air conditioning can be limited to critical clinical spaces only\u2014ensuring physical well-being through passive design while also saving on energy bills.\n\nAdditionally, embracing cultural influences such as verandas, balconies with deep overhangs, or stepped-back terraces can foster a healthy environment for healing and recovery by furthering the penetration of light and wind. Balconies along patient rooms and wards can also promote the smooth and calm recuperation of patients, enabling their path to recovery through safe engagements, including movements like walking and sitting.\n\nIntegrating art and landscape for safe and inclusive healing processes\n\nIncorporating local art into the healthcare facility can alleviate anger, fear, and stress, while enhancing feelings of pleasantness. Similarly, integrating indigenous vegetation that attracts birds and butterflies fosters a biodiverse microclimate, contributing to natural healing and patient recovery. The challenges outlined above underscore the urgent need for significant improvements in rural healthcare infrastructure. Many healthcare experts are advocating for the sector to be granted infrastructure status, along with a substantial boost in funding in the upcoming July budget. This investment is crucial to address the infrastructure deficit currently observed in rural healthcare. By prioritising sensitive design that respects the climate, culture, and local needs, while also integrating efficient spatial programming and zoning, and fostering physical and emotional well-being, rural healthcare facilities can be transformed into inclusive, accessible, and healing spaces for all."

            "extracted_text": "Bridging India's Urban-Rural Divide: Empowering Rural Communities for a Digital Future\n\nIndia's digital landscape presents a stark contrast between urban and rural sectors. While cities have leveraged technology and internet access to drive growth and innovation, rural areas continue to lag behind, struggling to access basic digital services. This disparity has sparked concerns about the widening urban-rural divide.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the critical issue of digital literacy in India, examining the effectiveness of government initiatives and programs aimed at bridging this gap and empowering rural communities to participate in the digital economy.\n\nThe Urban-Rural Divide in India\n\nThe digital divide between urban and rural areas in India is significant. According to the National Sample Survey Office, only 24% of rural households have internet access, compared to 66% in urban areas. This disparity limits access to vital resources such as information, education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Additionally, the lack of digital skills in the rural population exacerbates these challenges, leading to a cycle of poverty and exclusion.\n\nThis divide is particularly pronounced for rural women, who face more obstacles than their urban counterparts due to limited education and career opportunities. Furthermore, digital illiteracy has recently become a prerequisite for participating in the New Economy, which widens the gap between men and women.\n\nGovernment Policies and Programs\n\nThe Indian government has launched several initiatives to bridge the digital divide and enhance digital literacy among rural communities. Key Initiatives:\n\nPradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA): Launched in 2017, PMGDISHA aims to empower 60 million rural households with basic digital skills, focusing on at least one member per household.\n\nBharatNet Project: This initiative connects 250,000 gram panchayats (village councils) with high-speed internet, promoting digital literacy and online access.\n\nThese initiatives demonstrate the government's commitment to creating a digitally inclusive society. By improving digital literacy, India can unlock opportunities for economic growth, social empowerment, and civic engagement.\n\nThe Role of NGOs and Community-Based Programs\n\nBeyond government initiatives, numerous NGOs have played a vital role in enhancing digital literacy in rural India. The NIIT Foundation, for instance, offers tailored training programs that cater to local needs. These comprehensive trainings span basic computer skills, online safety, and entrepreneurial expertise, empowering participants to leverage technology for economic growth.\n\nCommunity-based initiatives have proven particularly effective, as they foster trust and relevance within local contexts. By engaging local leaders and leveraging existing community structures, these programs achieve higher participation rates and greater impact. This grassroots approach ensures that digital literacy training is not only accessible but also responsive to the unique needs and aspirations of rural communities.\n\nImpact on Access to Services\n\nDigital literacy programs can be a transformative tool in making government services accessible to all segments of the population. With more than half of healthcare and social security benefits now available online, it is essential for rural citizens to possess digital literacy.\n\nFor instance, the SS Rajasthan Single Sign-On can help facilitate access to over 40 government services, streamlining procedures and promoting greater transparency and efficiency. This digital access allows individuals to easily utilize schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM Kisan), which supports income generation for farmers.\n\nHowever, there is a concerning side: approximately 27 percent of beneficiaries still lack digital access. Enhancing digital skills and providing support through smartphones can significantly improve participation in these programs and, in turn, positively impact rural empowerment overall.\n\nChallenges Ahead\n\nDespite significant efforts to promote digital literacy, several challenges persist, hindering the effectiveness of these initiatives. Key obstacles include:\n\nInfrastructure deficits: Many rural areas lack basic internet infrastructure, rendering digital literacy efforts futile.\n\nAffordability issues: The high cost of devices and internet connections makes digital access unattainable for numerous households.\n\nLanguage inaccessibility: Online content is predominantly available in widely spoken languages, excluding speakers of lesser-known dialects.\n\nResistance to change: Cultural and traditional beliefs often resist technological advancements, perceiving them as a disruption to established systems\n\nTo address these challenges, a collaborative approach is necessary. Partnering with government agencies, NGOs, and private sector entities can help:\n\n1 Develop targeted infrastructure development programs\n\n2. Implement affordable digital access initiatives\n\n3. Create multilingual online content\n\n4. Promote cultural sensitivity and awareness about the benefits of digital literacy.\n\nBy working together, we can overcome these barriers and pave the way for a more digitally inclusive society.\n\nConclusion\n\nDigital literacy programs are pivotal in empowering Indians with the skills necessary to thrive in an increasingly digital world. By enhancing access to information and services, these initiatives foster economic empowerment, social inclusion, and a more equitable society.\n\nHowever, achieving digital inclusivity in India will be a long-term endeavor, requiring significant investments in infrastructure development, affordability initiatives, and grassroots awareness programs. Rural areas, in particular, need targeted interventions to bridge the digital divide and leverage technology for socio-economic growth.\n\nBy unlocking India's vast talent pool, digital literacy can propel the nation toward a brighter, more egalitarian future. A future where every citizen has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of geographical location or socio-economic background. As India strives to become a digitally inclusive society, digital literacy will play a transformative role in shaping its destiny."

            "extracted_text": "The review of the literature section of this paper delves into the existing academic research and expert opinions on the digitization of public services in India. It examines the gaps and challenges identified in previous studies, focusing on the digital divide, digital literacy, and the adoption of ICT in rural areas. The section also highlights the need for innovative solutions and strategic approaches to bridge the gaps and promote inclusive development in the country.\n\nTheoretical framework\n\nThe theoretical framework of this study is centered on the intricate relationship between digitalization and transaction cost analysis (TCA). Transaction cost analysis, rooted in the seminal works of Williamson (2010), provides a lens through which to examine the costs associated with conducting economic and social transactions. These transaction costs encompass factors such as information search, negotiation, and enforcement, which can be significant barriers in traditional, paper-based systems. Digitalization, on the other hand, has the potential to drastically reduce these transaction costs by offering efficient and immediate access to information, enabling digital contracting, and automating monitoring and enforcement through electronic records and data analytics (Gielens & Steenkamp, 2019).\n\nWithin the context of government services, India\u2019s Digital India Program (DIP) exemplifies the transformative power of digitalization in reducing transaction costs. The DIP\u2019s core objectives, such as electronic service delivery, digital resources, and cashless transactions, are inherently linked to the reduction of transaction costs. By enabling citizens to access government services with ease through digital platforms, the program minimizes the need for time-consuming manual processes and paperwork (Demmou & Sagot, 2021). Additionally, the enhanced transparency and accountability facilitated by digitalization further contribute to the reduction of transaction costs in governance processes (Paolucci et al., 2021). In the business sector, digitalization has led to the automation of various business processes, supply chain management, and e-commerce. These digital advancements have resulted in reduced transaction costs related to procurement, contracting, and monitoring (Dutta et al., 2020). By providing a digital platform for business transactions, companies can achieve cost savings through improved efficiency and reduced information asymmetry. This reduction in transaction costs is particularly significant for startups and small businesses, contributing to economic development and job creation, as evident in initiatives like Startup India and Standup India (Ordanini & Pol, 2001).\n\nThe Digital India initiative\n\nDigital technology has emerged as a crucial catalyst for India\u2019s economic growth and the pursuit of social and economic equity by enhancing access to information, public services, and markets, thus addressing the country\u2019s infrastructure deficit (Kumar, 2019; Vijayan, 2019). The potential of digital technology to transform India into a just and equitable society while propelling it to the forefront of nations is evident, particularly considering the country\u2019s young population\u2019s adaptability and innovative spirit (Gurumurthy et al., 2014; Kumar, 2019). In line with this vision, the \u2018Digital India\u2019 initiative was launched on July 1, 2015, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aiming to create a tech-empowered and knowledgeable society where government services are easily accessible to all citizens, fostering digital and economic empowerment (Thomas, 2019).\n\nIn 2018, the country had a staggering 560 million internet subscribers, positioning it as the second-largest market after China. Notably, Indian mobile data users exhibit high monthly data consumption, averaging 8.3 gigabits (GB). This surpasses the average of 5.5 GB in China and falls within the range of 8.0 to 8.5 GB observed in South Korea, a technologically advanced digital economy (McKinsey Global Institute, 2019). This growth can be attributed to the substantial improvements in internet infrastructure and increased internet access, providing opportunities for public and private stakeholders to deliver digital services (Athique, 2019). However, despite these advancements, India\u2019s e-governance provision lags, with a ranking of 107th, primarily due to challenges associated with the Aadhaar card system, which poses difficulties for individuals in rural areas to access secure services. Concerns regarding data protection efficiency and effectiveness have also arisen in relation to Aadhaar (Gowd, 2022).\n\nKumar (2019) acknowledged the substantial improvements achieved in the program\u2019s three key areas: electronic delivery of public services and financial support, creation of a national digital infrastructure, and enhancement of digital awareness and literacy. India has emerged as one of the world\u2019s fastest digitizing nations, driven by increased mobile connectivity, exponential data consumption, nationwide internet infrastructure expansion through the BharatNet program, and the emergence of digital transformation startups catering to millions of Indians (Raj & Aithal, 2018). The success of the Jandhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) initiative, which has provided digital identities to over a billion Indian citizens and access to the banking system for previously excluded individuals, stands as a significant outcome of the Digital India initiative (Sekhri & OSD, 2020).\n\nThe Digital India initiative has also introduced several services and mobile applications to facilitate accessibility and participation. For instance, the Accessible India Campaign Mobile App aims to create equal opportunities and inclusivity for people with disabilities, allowing them to participate fully in all aspects of life in an inclusive society (Agrawal et al., 2022). The Agri Market App provides farmers with crop price information within a 50 km radius, discouraging distress sales and empowering farmers with market insights (Deininger, 2017). The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign focuses on eliminating gender discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for girls in education and society (Parmar & Sharma, 2020). The Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) aims to enhance policing efficiency and effectiveness through the integration of e-governance principles and nationwide networking infrastructure for crime investigation and criminal detection (Sharma, 2021).\n\nOther notable initiatives under the Digital India Program include the E-Hospital system, which facilitates seamless health information management across multiple hospitals, and the E-MSIPS platform, which enables online submission and scrutiny of applications for schemes related to electronics manufacturing and clusters (Nair, 2019). Kud (2023) highlights the pivotal role of the Goods and Service Tax Network (GSTN) in India\u2019s taxation system. As a trusted national information utility, the GSTN facilitates a unified interface for taxpayers and fosters shared IT infrastructure between the central and state governments. The primary objective of the GSTN is to establish a seamless and cost-effective Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime in the country. By providing a common platform for tax-related processes, the GSTN streamlines tax compliance and enhances efficiency in the overall taxation system, benefiting both taxpayers and the government. The National Ujala Dashboard promotes energy efficiency at the residential level, raising awareness about the benefits of using energy-efficient appliances and facilitating higher uptake of LED lights. Lastly, the Unified Mobile Application for New-Age Governance (UMANG) serves as a single-point access platform for various government services, simplifying the user experience and reducing the inconvenience of managing multiple mobile apps (Chunekar & Sreenivas, 2019).\n\nDigital empowerment of rural India\n\nDigital technology has brought about significant transformations in the lives of people, particularly in rural areas, by empowering and connecting them (Iivari et al., 2020). DIP was initiated with the objective of providing increased access to technology in rural regions through high-speed internet networks and enhancing digital literacy (Burman, 2021). This endeavor has presented Indians with the opportunity to leverage cutting-edge technology, leading to a transformation of the rural service industry (Rani, 2016). The program has facilitated IT training for students and villagers, equipping them with the necessary skills for employment in the ICT sector. Rural residents have been trained by telecom service providers to address local internet needs, resulting in the creation of job opportunities in the service industry (Vij, 2018).\n\nOne of the key impacts of DIP in rural areas has been the creation of community internet awareness (Banu, 2017). With the majority of Indians residing in rural regions, internet connectivity has played a crucial role in transforming these areas into digitally empowered societies, ensuring that everyone has access to the internet. The program has enabled rural communities, many of whom are economically disadvantaged, to access wireless internet, utilize digital platforms, and efficiently leverage e-Services (Nayak, 2018). This initiative has not only reduced the reliance on paper-based processes but has also resulted in significant resource savings for poor rural communities. By spending less time and money on accessing services, these communities contribute to a cleaner environment and promote sustainable practices (Jani & Tere, 2015).\n\nMoreover, DIP has extended its benefits to farmers by offering them digital services. This virtual platform has connected farmers to national agricultural markets and provided access to technological advancements (Tripathi & Dungarwal, 2020). Farmers can access information on crop prices through mobile phones, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimize their agricultural practices. This integration of technology in the agricultural sector has opened up opportunities for increased productivity and income generation among rural farmers (Gond & Gupta, 2017).\n\nDIP has also played a crucial role in driving economic growth, both in rural and urban areas. Government initiatives under the program, such as economic reforms, digitization, and smart cities, have attracted foreign direct investments (FDIs) and facilitated relaxed economic policies (Behera, 2021).\n\nFurthermore, DIP has facilitated real-time education for rural communities, addressing the issue of teacher scarcity in India\u2019s education system through smart and virtual classrooms (Kamath, 2021). Mobile devices have also been utilized to educate farmers and fishers on intelligent farming and fishing techniques, enhancing productivity and livelihoods (Sein-Echaluce et al., 2019). The availability of high-speed internet connectivity in rural areas has facilitated access to online education platforms, bridging the digital divide and providing supplemental educational resources to rural communities (Rizvi & Nabi, 2021).\n\nThe digital empowerment of rural India through DIP has brought significant socio-economic benefits. By promoting digital literacy and providing access to technology, DIP has empowered individuals in rural areas, enabling them to participate in the digital economy and improve their livelihoods. The program has not only created job opportunities in the service industry, but has also facilitated the growth of businesses in rural and urban areas alike (Nedungadi et al., 2018).\n\nMoreover, the program has enhanced connectivity in rural India, bridging the infrastructure gap and enabling individuals and communities to access digital services and information. With community internet awareness, rural areas have transformed into digitally empowered societies where wireless internet and e-services have become readily accessible. This has led to increased efficiency, reduced costs, and improved access to essential services for rural communities, ultimately contributing to their overall development (Banu, 2017).\n\nIn addition to its social and economic impact, DIP has played a vital role in attracting foreign direct investments and driving economic growth. The program\u2019s focus on digitization, economic reforms, and the development of smart cities has created a conducive environment for investment and technological advancements (Bhasin, 2016). By aligning with international service standards and promoting a tech-empowered society, India has positioned itself as an attractive destination for global investments, leading to economic modernization and improved export capabilities (Nugroho et al., 2021). Farmers can connect with national agricultural markets by leveraging digital tools and services, expanding their market reach, and reducing reliance on intermediaries.\n\nDigital India Program barriers\n\nDigital divide\n\nThe digital divide remains a significant barrier to the effective implementation of DIP. The divide refers to the disparity in internet connectivity and access between those who have it and those who do not (Jamil, 2021). In India, the digital divide is particularly pronounced between the rural and urban populations (Warf, 2019). Kar et al. (2018) highlighted that in 2017, 64 percent of the urban population had internet connectivity, while only 20 percent of rural residents were connected. This disparity can be attributed to several factors, including the complex economic conditions and cultural diversity of India (Ravindranath & Sundarakumar, 2021).\n\nAdditionally, India faces a shortage of skilled professionals capable of imparting essential digital skills to the population. The availability of formal digital skills training is limited, with a low percentage of India\u2019s workforce reported to have received such training (Agarwal et al., 2023). The linguistic diversity in the country, with over 216 mother tongues, further complicates the challenge of digital literacy. This diversity, combined with functional illiteracy and limited English proficiency, creates barriers to understanding and acquiring digital language skills. It is imperative to address these challenges in order to promote digital inclusivity and empower individuals in India\u2019s digital era (Mahapatra & Anderson, 2023).\n\nDIP adoption strategies\n\nTo address the barriers to DIP adoption, two strategies/policies can be employed:\n\nRight of way (RoW) policy: The implementation of an effective RoW policy can play a crucial role in bridging the digital divide and improving internet connectivity in rural areas. The RoW policy, introduced by India\u2019s Department of Telecommunications in 2016, aims to facilitate the seamless acquisition of land for laying optic fiber cables and setting up mobile towers. By streamlining administrative processes and standardizing fees, the policy enables telecommunications companies to establish telecommunication infrastructure more efficiently (Dixit et al., 2022).\n\nUnder the RoW policy, telecommunication companies are required to electronically apply for laying down telecommunication infrastructure, ensuring transparency, cost-effectiveness, and timely deployment of optic fiber across India. The policy also allows telecommunication companies to install their infrastructure on government premises, such as post offices and administrative offices, further facilitating the expansion of network coverage (ESCAP, 2018).\n\nTo ensure the success of the RoW policy, close monitoring by both central and state governments is essential. Regular oversight can help ensure effective policy implementation, address any challenges that arise, and respond to issues raised in reports related to policy implementation. Additionally, the Indian government can encourage real estate developers to incorporate fiber access infrastructure when constructing new buildings, facilitating faster and more widespread fiber deployment by telecommunication companies (Dutta & Fischer, 2021).\n\nGovernment sensitization: Government sensitization programs can play a vital role in addressing digital illiteracy and the digital divide. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, along with other relevant ministries, can organize awareness programs to educate the population on digital technologies, their benefits, and how to effectively utilize them (Goedhart et al., 2019).\n\nThese awareness programs should be designed to target different segments of the population, including rural communities. They can include workshops, training sessions, and interactive sessions with government officials, industry experts, and technology providers. The programs can focus on various aspects, such as digital payments, access to online services, and government schemes and platforms like the Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) and Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) (Bhatt, 2019).\n\nThe design of these programs can be based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), which aims to predict behavioral intentions and factors that influence individuals\u2019 adoption of technology. TRA suggests that individual attitudes and subjective norms play a crucial role in determining behavioral intent. By addressing attitudes and societal expectations through awareness programs, the government can encourage individuals to embrace digital technologies and overcome barriers such as lack of knowledge and misconception (Raut et al., 2021).\n\nMoreover, these sensitization programs should be ongoing and regularly updated to reflect the evolving technology landscape. Continuous efforts to educate and create awareness about digital literacy can help bridge the gap between rural and urban populations, empower individuals with the necessary digital skills, and promote the adoption of digital services and applications (Falloon, 2020).\n\nThe digitization of public services in India has made significant progress, but there are still gaps and challenges that need to be addressed. The existing literature highlights the digital divide and digital literacy as key factors affecting the adoption of ICT in rural areas (Acilar & S\u00e6b\u00f8, 2023; Lythreatis et al., 2022). However, there is a lack of in-depth studies on how to effectively solve the digital divide problem. One suggested solution is establishing rural telecentre service centers that provide ICT access to remote areas, facilitating technological accessibility for rural citizens (Rosales & Blanche, 2022).\n\nWhile India has experienced success in e-governance and ICT initiatives, there are still challenges to overcome. Capacity building to utilize e-governance services, investments in and access to ICTs, and promoting people\u2019s participation in e-democracy are identified as key challenges. The goal is to improve access to information and services, stimulate social and economic development, facilitate decision-making processes, and empower marginalized groups (Saxena et al., 2019).\n\nThe literature also emphasizes the rural\u2013urban disparities in India, which are the largest in the world. Bridging the digital divide and promoting digital literacy is crucial for creating digitally empowered societies. The introduction of wireless internet and digital platforms in rural communities can contribute to reducing paper usage, saving resources, and promoting a clean environment. Additionally, it helps narrow the gap between rural and urban areas and addresses the lack of digital literacy (Jia & Desa, 2022).\n\nExploring the socio-economic impact of digital financial inclusion initiatives in rural areas of India\n\nAdoption Rates of the Digital India Program among Different Demographic Groups refers to an analysis or examination of the extent to which various demographic groups within the population have embraced and utilized the Digital India Program. DIP is a government initiative to promote digital inclusion and transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy (Reddick et al., 2020).\n\nBy studying the adoption rates among different demographic groups, researchers can identify patterns and disparities in the uptake of digital technology within DIP. Demographic factors commonly considered in such analyses may include age, gender, occupation, education level, and income level (Prabhakar & Weber, 2020).\n\nUnderstanding the adoption rates among different demographic groups provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the Digital India Program in targeting specific populations and promoting digital inclusion (Nayak et al., 2019). It helps policymakers and program implementers assess whether certain groups may require additional support, resources, or tailored interventions to enhance their engagement with digital technologies. Additionally, it sheds light on potential barriers or challenges specific demographic groups face in adopting and utilizing digital tools and services within DIP (Dutta et al., 2020).\n\nConceptual framework\n\nThe conceptual framework for this study aims to investigate the factors influencing the adoption and utilization of digital information and technological innovation among rural populations in India. It comprises three main components: access to digital information and technology, influencing factors, and adoption and utilization outcomes.\n\nAccess to digital information and technology:\n\nAvailability of digital infrastructure (e.g., internet connectivity, mobile networks)\n\nAvailability of digital devices (e.g., smartphones, computers)\n\nAccessibility of digital platforms and services\n\nInfluencing factors:\n\nDemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, occupation)\n\nPerceived usefulness and ease of use of digital technology\n\nDigital literacy and skills\n\nSocio-economic factors (e.g., income level, education level)\n\nGovernment initiatives and support\n\nAdoption and utilization outcomes:\n\nThe extent of digital information access and utilization\n\nEngagement in online activities and communication\n\nSocio-economic impact and empowerment\n\nThis conceptual framework provides a structure for analyzing the data collected from the survey and helps establish connections between the variables under investigation. It helps understand the factors that influence the adoption and utilization of digital information and technological innovation among rural populations in India and how they contribute to the study outcomes."
